<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Sir Fredrick Bramwell</span> once
calculated that if a man made up his
mind to be killed in a railway accident, he
would have to travel night and day in express
trains for 900 years in order to fulfil
his purpose. But such a happy state of
affairs did not always exist.</p>

<p>In 1859, when there were only some
10,000 miles of railway in the United
Kingdom, and the number of persons
carried was about 175,000,000, it was
calculated that one out of every 8,708,411
passengers was killed <em>from causes beyond his
own control;</em> while in 1897, when over
21,000 miles of railway were in operation,
and considerably over 1,000,000,000 passengers
were carried, the average was one
in about every 26,500,000.</p>

<p>Indeed, in the sixties railway disasters
were of such frequent occurrence that, on
December 27th, 1867, Her Majesty wrote
to the directors of the various railway companies
in London requesting them "to be
as careful of other passengers as of herself."
Now, owing to the stringent regulations
of the Board of Trade, the infallible
block system, and interlocking of signals
and points, it is impossible for a signalman
to err without the grossest culpable negligence.
The railway companies, too, have
considerably improved their permanent
ways, constructed heavier rolling stock,
while the contrivances for controlling and
maintaining the trains in check are of the
most perfect description.</p>

<p>But there is an old adage that "accidents
will happen in the best regulated
families." The railway is no exception
to the rule, and, notwithstanding multitudinous
and careful precautions, and the
extreme vigilance displayed by officials,
the community is startled now and again
by the news of some dreadful catastrophe
that has overwhelmed the iron steed.
Fortunately, accidents are few and far between,
while the number of passengers
killed is infinitesimal&mdash;the total last year
was only thirty-four.</p>

<p>It is a fortunate circumstance that in
these days of lightning travelling a train
very seldom comes to grief through travelling
too rapidly. Yet such a disaster occurred
between Heathfield and Mayfield on
the Eastbourne section of the London,
Brighton, and South Coast Railway last
year. For the length of about twenty miles
this railway is a single line, and meanders
along through the valleys among the hills,
so as to avoid tunnelling, in the most zigzag
manner. Between Heathfield and
Mayfield, a distance of about four miles,
there are a series of steep rising and falling
gradients, many of one in fifty, and sharp
<em class="sans-serif">S</em> curves.</p>

<p>It was while travelling round one of
these curves of nearly a third of a mile
radius at a speed of from twenty-five to
thirty miles an hour, that a train was derailed
and the greater portion of it precipitated
down an embankment sixty feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
high. The engine fortunately fell over and
remained by the side of the permanent
way. Our tail-piece conveys a very good
idea of the sharp curve, and also of the
gradient. Although many of the carriages
were smashed, only the driver was killed,
and possibly, had he stuck to his engine,
his life might have been spared.</p>

<p>Some of the passengers, as is generally
the case in railway disasters, had marvellous
escapes. One gentleman, who was sitting
reading, suddenly felt the carriage give a
lurch and then roll over and over down the
embankment, while he was tossed violently
about, till it crashed into another, when the
superstructure was torn from its foundations.
Considering the gravity of the
accident it was a wonder that there was
not a heavier death roll. As it was, it
cost the company £13,000 for compensation
to the injured.</p>

<p>The most shocking disaster that has ever
happened upon any railway in the United
Kingdom, excelling even the famous Tay
Bridge disaster, when 74 passengers were
killed by the bridge having collapsed, occurred
on the North of Ireland Railway on
June 12th, 1889, at Killooney. It is known
as the Armagh accident.</p>

FOR COMPENSATION.</p>

</div>

<p>A holiday excursion had been arranged
by the teachers connected with a Sunday-school
in Armagh. The place selected
was Warrenpoint, on Carlingford Bay.
The number of excursionists was about
1,200, mostly children of both sexes, with
a few parents. The first train, consisting
of 13 carriages and a brake-van, drawn by
one engine, set off at 10 o'clock with
940 passengers. The officials at the station
had been rather sceptical of the
adequacy of one engine to draw the train,
especially as there is a steep incline of 1 in
75, running along an embankment 60 feet
high, at Killooney, two miles from Armagh.
The driver, however, expressed absolute
confidence in the capability of his engine.</p>

<p>Shortly after the excursion had left
Armagh, an ordinary passenger train
followed it from the same station at its
scheduled time; but, owing to the excursion
being heavily laden and unable to
proceed very rapidly, the ordinary gained
upon it, and was pulled up at Annaclare
Bridge, at the foot of the incline. Meanwhile
the first train was proceeding up the
incline with great difficulty, and when
halfway up came to a dead stoppage, the
load proving too heavy for the engine.</p>

<p>The traffic master of the line, who was
travelling with the train, knowing that the
ordinary must be but a short distance
behind, rendering shunting back to Armagh
for additional locomotive power impossible,
ordered the train to be divided, in spite
of the objection and remonstrances of the
guard and some of the passengers. As
a precaution, he ordered stones to be
placed under the wheels of the last carriage
of the detached section to prevent
its running away. The first part of the
train, in starting, set back a trifle&mdash;not
much, but sufficient to give the second half,
consisting of seven carriages, crammed
with its full complement of passengers, a
start. The brakes were immediately applied,
but were absolutely ineffectual, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the train, gathering momentum every
minute, ran backwards towards Annaclare
Bridge. Who shall describe the feelings
of the unfortunate passengers, many of
whom knew they were rushing to inevitable
destruction, and yet were unable
to do anything to prevent it or to save
themselves?</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE ARMAGH ACCIDENT IN WHICH 80 PERSONS
WERE KILLED AND 400 INJURED.</p>

<p><i>Hunter &amp; Co., Armagh, Photo</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>After running a mile and a half, it
dashed into the stationary train with a
frightful crash. The force of the impact
was terrific, and, although no one in the
ordinary train was seriously hurt, the engine
was overturned, crushing four children
beneath it. All the carriages in the excursion
train were wrecked. Some were
smashed to atoms, scarcely one timber
being left joined to another; many were
telescoped, and formed a fearful pile, which
in turn was mounted by one carriage almost
intact.</p>

<p>The scene that followed baffles description.
There being few men among the
unfortunate party, and some of the officers
accompanying the train having been seriously
injured, a terrible panic ensued. The
agonising cries of the wounded, and the
frantic shrieks and exhortations for help
from the imprisoned children, were sufficient
to make the boldest shudder. But
the teachers soon regained their presence
of mind, and, help having arrived from
Armagh, the work of rescue was begun.</p>

<p>It was fraught with great difficulty, and
attended with grave danger, as the huge
pieces of timber were poised in the most
dangerous positions, threatening to fall
every minute, and bury both rescuers and
rescued beneath them.</p>

<p>Some fragments of the carriages and a
few of the bodies had been thrown promiscuously
down the embankment by the
force of the collision, but the bulk of the
wreck and the greater part of the unfortunate
victims were to be found within
a limited area. Eighty persons were
killed, nearly all children, and about 400
were injured. The work of extrication
was horrible, many of the passengers being
so crushed and battered as to be absolutely
unrecognisable, but they were eventually
laid out on the bank with care.</p>

<p>Great honour is due to the heroic conduct
and intrepidity displayed by a soldier&mdash;Private
Cox, of the Royal Irish Fusiliers&mdash;who
was in the runaway train.
When he realised that no human power
could avert the appalling disaster, he
stepped out on to the foot-board, and, with
death staring him in the face, withdrew the
frightened children from the compartments
as rapidly as he could, and dropped them
on to the bank, where they were afterwards
discovered almost unhurt. Nor did he
desist until the trains had almost met,
when he sprang off just in the nick of time
to save his own life, and worked arduously
in the extrication of the dead and injured.
This was truly a splendid exhibition of
courage.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A TERRIBLE EMBRACE&mdash;THE SMASH UP OF THE
CAPE MAIL EXPRESS.</p>

<p><i>Petherick, Taunton, Photo</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Norton Fitzwarren, a short distance from
Taunton on the Great Western Railway,
was the scene of a calamitous catastrophe
on November 11th, 1890, when the Cape
Mail from Plymouth dashed into a stationary
goods train while hurtling along at
50 miles an hour. The 6.45 goods train
from Bristol had been shunted on to the
up line at Norton Fitzwarren to let the 9.55
express goods train from Bristol pass by.
It was about 2 o'clock in the morning, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
while the slow goods
was thus waiting on
the up line, the
signalman received
warning of the approach
of the special
express train carrying
passengers from
the Cape liner <i>Norham
Castle</i>, which
had arrived at Plymouth
the evening
before, to London,
and, forgetting all
about the goods
train, signalled "all
clear." The result
was a frightful collision.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 527px;">

AND LUGGAGE ON THE RACK.</p>

<p><i>Petherick, Taunton, Photo</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Both engines were
locked firmly together
and completely
wrecked; all
the exterior fittings,
including the funnel on the boiler of the express, were demolished and carried away,
while the boiler itself was torn open. The broken carriages, trucks, and other débris
made an awful pile about 30 feet in height. Neither the fireman nor driver of the mail
were killed, though they were terribly injured, owing to the fact that the
engine had a heavy coal tender, which telescoped into the carriages immediately
behind it, that bore the brunt of the crash from the rear.
The driver of this train certainly was not born to be killed in a railway
smash, having been in two serious accidents anterior to the Norton
disaster, narrowly escaping with his life each time. A party of
miners returning from the South African mines to the North of England
were travelling in the first
carriage, and were nearly
all killed on the spot.
So were also a
party of card
players in the
same coach, with
the exception of
one young fellow
who, having suffered
great losses,
had the good
sense to give up
playing and to
leave the compartment
at Exeter
for another
one in the rear of
the train, and thus he
probably saved his life.
In one compartment the
occupants, including
women and children, had
a most marvellous escape,
the glass in the windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
not even being broken, while that in every other compartment was
shivered to fragments.</p>

<p>Another frightful accident,
due to the negligence
of the signalman, happened
at Manor House Cabin,
near Thirsk, on the North-Eastern
Railway, in a
dense fog, on the night of
November 2nd, 1892, by
which ten persons lost
their lives. A goods train
was standing in the station
on the main line. The
signalman, being fatigued,
dropped asleep at his post.
Presently he was awakened
rather sharply by the
ominous rumbling of the
Scotch express, which had
left Edinburgh for London at 10.30, and was now travelling at full speed. The
signalman jumped to his feet, and, forgetting all about the stationary goods train
waiting in the station on the same set of metals, signalled the approaching train.</p>

<p>On came the express through the dense fog, and crashed into the goods train with
such force that the engines and all the carriages, with the exception of a Pullman
sleeping-car, were thrown off the line. The carriages were all piled up, and the horrors
of the catastrophe were accentuated by the broken and splintered wreckage catching fire.
In our illustration the engine may be descried on the right, but a
skeleton of its former
majestic self, surrounded
by a heterogeneous mass
of broken wheels, iron
joists, twisted and fashioned
into the most fantastic
shapes by the joint agencies
of the collision and
fire.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE PULLMAN CAR AND ENGINE AFTER THE THIRSK COLLISION.</p>

<p><i>Clarke, Thirsk, Photo</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The Pullman car, or
rather the charred remains
of it, presents a most
bizarre though painful
object, being quite
destitute of those
many sumptuous embellishments
which
characterised it but a
few hours previously.
The Marquesses of
Tweeddale and
Huntly were travelling
in this car,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
but they fortunately escaped without injury.</p>

<p>Some commiseration should be extended
to the signalman, however, as he had been
up at home since six o'clock that morning,
his youngest child having died the day
before. When he went on duty at eight
o'clock in the evening he begged the stationmaster
to excuse him under the painful
circumstances, but no substitute could be
found, and he resumed his duties in the
ordinary course of things, with the result
that Nature, who would not be denied,
caused the signalman to sleep. The railway
company were severely censured in the
subsequent inquiry for the long hours of
duty inflicted upon signalmen.</p>

<p>January 3rd of this year recorded another
deplorable disaster on the Scottish extension
of the Great Northern Railway,
the North British Railway, in which
the East Coast express, which left King's
Cross the previous night, came to grief
outside Dunbar station, not far from
Edinburgh. The night was foggy, and
owing to this and other violent inclemencies
of the weather it arrived at the
border town of Berwick twenty-five minutes
late. At Dunbar station a mineral train
was being shunted across the main line into
a siding to allow this express to pass by,
when one of the waggons became derailed.
It was into this that the express dashed,
completely knocking the obstacle into a
thousand pieces, but the force of the collision
caused the first of the two engines to
leave the metals and plough through the
sleepers and permanent way for about
thirty yards, when it fell over on to its side,
leaving the tender upright.</p>

</div>

<p>The second engine, although it did not
share the fate of its leader, was greatly
damaged. The carriage next to the engine
was telescoped by the heavier corridor
coaches behind. By the force of the impact
many of the waggons fell upon a
corridor coach, staving in the side and
smashing the framework and glass of
the windows to atoms. In this carriage
the intercommunicating corridor extended
longitudinally down one side of the car,
and fortunately it was this side that bore
the brunt of the violence of the collision.</p>

<p>Had it been otherwise the death roll
would have been increased terribly. As it
was, one lady was killed. Curiously enough
this unfortunate lady, who was travelling
with her sister, had only just changed her
seat with the latter. Had she retained her
seat her sister, in all probability, would
have been killed instead.</p>

<p>A runaway goods-waggon was the cause
of another very extraordinary accident
on the London and North-Western Railway
at Chelford, near Crewe, on Dec. 22nd
four years ago, by which the Manchester
mail was completely wrecked. A violent
gale was raging at the time, and a waggon
standing in a siding at Chelford station was
blown on to the main line, along which the
mail was signalled
to pass. The express,
dashing
along at the rate
of a mile a minute,
struck the waggon
with tremendous
force, literally
jumping over it and
then falling over.</p>

<p>The engine-driver
had a most
Providential escape,
being hurled
off his engine over
a hedge into a
ploughed field, with
no more serious injuries
than a few
bruises. The truck
was tossed on one
side into the air and
struck the pillars of
the station, ripping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
a portion out of the
side of a heavy
coach during its
aerial flight. It
then rebounded into
a carriage in the
centre of the train
with direful effect. One
coach, as will be seen
in the illustration, was
utterly smashed, the
flooring, wheels, and
interior being swept
entirely away, while the
sides were torn out. All
the remaining carriages
in its rear were completely
wrecked.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE CHELFORD ACCIDENT, CAUSED BY A SINGLE WAGGON.</p>

<p><i>Leech, Macclesfield, Photo</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Some were overturned
on their sides,
and one was so turned over
as to stand on end, while an
eye-witness stated "that
some of the carriages were
broken through by the carriage
behind causing both sides of the
interior compartments to meet
and demolish the fittings." All together
fourteen persons were killed and
about forty or fifty injured, one lady having
both her legs cut off.</p>

<p>Abbots Ripton, near Huntingdon, on
the Great Northern Railway, was the scene
of a terrible collision&mdash;or, rather, two collisions&mdash;on
January 21st, 1876. A coal
train of 33 waggons and a brake-van left
Peterborough for London at 6 p.m. It
was 18 minutes late in starting. The
weather was extremely boisterous and
stormy, while the snow fell in large flakes
thickly and fast, seriously obscuring the
outlook of the driver and guard of the
train. The latter had seen the signals at
Holme Station, and at the blocks at Conington
and Wood Walton, which showed
"all clear."</p>

<p><i>Bamforth, Holmfirth, Photo</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>At Abbots Ripton the train slackened
speed, as it was signalled to cross into a
siding to permit the Scotch express, which
was due from Edinburgh for London, to
go by. The greater part of the goods
train had passed safely into the siding when
the Scotch express dashed into it at full
speed with most disastrous results. By
the force of the collision the engine of the
Scotch express jumped across the down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
line on to the bank, where it fell on to its broadside,
dragging with it the tender and three or four succeeding
carriages. Hunt, the
guard of the coal train, displayed
great presence of mind. He asked
the signalman if he had blocked
the down line, but the latter was
so agitated by the disaster&mdash;which
had happened within a
few yards of his box&mdash;that he inadvertently
declared he had.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 419px;">

<div class="caption"><p>THE SMASH AT NEW CROSS, IN WHICH THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED.</p>

<p><i>Thiele, Photo</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Hunt, feeling satisfied thereupon,
left the box and rejoined
his train, but, as a further precaution,
thrust some fog signals
into his pocket, which he placed
on the rails of the down line.
In less than ten minutes after
the collision the driver and
guard of the coal train set off
to Huntingdon for assistance.
They had not proceeded more
than 800 yards when the Leeds
down express, which had started
from London at 6 p.m., was discerned
dashing at top speed
through the blinding storm. The
driver of the coal train furiously
sounded his whistle, while the
guard waved his red lamp frantically
to arrest the express. But
it was too late, and it plunged into, and
literally cut its way through, the wreck of
the Scotch train.</p>

<p>The scene was a terrible one. The
howling storm, the heartrending shrieks
of the injured, the shouts of the rescuers
and cries for help, the lurid glare of the
burning wreckage, produced a scene
never to be forgotten by those who witnessed
it. All together fourteen persons
were killed.</p>

</div>

<p>The South-Eastern Railway has long
enjoyed a remarkable immunity from railway
smashes, but this record was sadly
marred a few months ago, when three
persons were killed in a stationary train
while standing outside
St. John's station,
near New Cross,
by the Hastings express,
through the
inadvertence of the
signalman, crashing
into it from behind.
Fortunately, owing
to the dense fog prevalent,
the express
was only travelling
at about eight miles
an hour; but even then the concussion
was sufficiently violent to
telescope the guard's van into the carriage
immediately preceding it, smashing it to
pieces as if it were constructed of cardboard.
It is wonderful that more lives
were not lost.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">(1) On the Field.</h3>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">A pitch-black</span> night in a rocky
valley of Afghanistan: a few stars
in the heavy, black, moonless sky only intensifying
the almost palpable darkness.
A mile or two southwards, where the rocky
valley swelled into rocky heights, little
flashes of light recurring at intervals, followed
by sharp little cracks, showed where
the late skirmish and retreat was fighting
itself out round about the camp.</p>

<p>Where one of the innumerable broken
ridges that seamed the valley made a
darker wall across the darkness, two figures
were dimly discernible (when you knew
where to look for them), the one semi-recumbent,
propped against a boulder, the
other tall and straight beside him.</p>

<p>"Clear out, Warrington&mdash;please go, sir,"
the voice came faintly from the recumbent
figure. "You can get back to camp and
send 'em out for me."</p>

<p>"Not likely, young 'un," observed the
other. "What says the great R.K.:</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"HE EMPTIED HIS REVOLVER INTO THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Don't!" said the wounded man, and
almost succeeded in stopping a groan
between his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>"Poor old Vicary," said Warrington,
bending over him. "Let me undo your
belt.... Now grab yourself with both
hands."</p>

<p>"Fellows in books," said the weak
voice, drowsily, "never get hit in the tummy....
Always&mdash;head in a bandage&mdash;or&mdash;arm
in sling.... Those Johnnies
that write books&mdash;ought to come out
with us."</p>

<p>There was silence for a time:
the far-off flashes grew more rare.
The wounded man shifted
himself a little and spoke
again.</p>

<p>"You're a brick, Warrington!"
he said.</p>

<p>"Slightly different from
Piccadilly and the Strand
this, eh, Vic?"</p>

<p>"I wish the mater could
see us now," said Vicary;
"she's going to bye-bye
just about now. She'd stick
you pretty high up in her
prayers if she
knew."</p>

<p>"The next time
you start talking
nonsense," said
Warrington, "I
shall consider you
delirious and past
hope; and I shall
turn tail and make
tracks for camp."</p>

<p>A long silence.</p>

<p>"It's getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
beastly cold," said Vicary, with a shiver;
"I shall never pull through to-night."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus-0012.jpg" width="530" height="407" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"A HOWLING HILLMAN STUMBLED OVER VICARY'S LEGS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Cheer up, lad," said Warrington, and
pulled at his moustache and glared at the
darkness; "only a few hours till daybreak....
Pity you're six foot four in your
boots and solid in proportion. I'm not
equal to two miles with you on my back,
my dainty midget."</p>

<p>"Can't see how you got me this far....
Why don't you sheer off now and get back,
and&mdash;&mdash;Oh, God! No! Warrington!...
You're not going?"</p>

<p>"Another word like that, my son, and I
leave you for Mr. and Mrs. Pathan and
all the little Pathans to play with."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;all right, I won't.... Let
me hold your boot&mdash;I can hardly see you.
Oh, Warry, what a funk I am; all the bit
o' pluck I had's run out of the leak in my
tunic&mdash;and I am beastly cold."</p>

<p>Warrington knelt beside him and cursed
beneath his breath, and felt his head and
hands. The former was very cold and
damp, the latter were very wet and warm.</p>

<p>"I must let them know they're wanted,
Vic!" he muttered.</p>

<p>The latter did not hear him.</p>

<p>"It'll be in to-morrow's despatches," he
murmured. "'Missing: Lieutenant
Beverley Warrington
and Second Lieutenant
Vicary of the &mdash;&mdash;' What's
up, Warry?"</p>

<p>His companion
had
touched his
forehead
lightly with
his lips, had risen to his feet, and, with his
arm raised above his head, had emptied his
revolver into the silence of the night.</p>

<p>"They'll know there's a British officer
where that revolver is," he said, cheerily.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but, you fool&mdash;you dear old silly
fool&mdash;so will those brown devils!"</p>

<p>"Can't help that!" said Warrington,
with a little laugh, "it's too chilly to stop
out late to-night." Then in a lower tone,
"For the sake of auld lang syne, Vic, my
boy."</p>

<p>He reloaded his revolver. When the
echoes had rattled away into deeper silence
they heard the distant shots suddenly
recommence, and distant shouts and howls
came to them like whispers. From the
invisible hills facing them came dim and
confused scuffling and scraping sounds as
of cats scrambling down rocks. A moving
white blur appeared somewhere in the
thick darkness, then another, and another;
and a suggestion of low-toned guttural
conversation reached Warrington's straining
ears. He shifted his revolver to his
left hand and gently drew his sword. Then
from over there where he knew the camp
lay came six revolver shots in quick succession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's Welby!" he said to himself.</p>

<p>Vicary's hand had been grasping the
heel of his foot tightly. Now he felt the
grip relax; and in a moment more the
wounded subaltern slipped a little with a
slight tinkle of steel on rock, and groaned.</p>

<p>In another moment a dozen howling
hillmen were blazing away at random towards
the spot whence the groan seemed
to have come. They aimed low and
erratically, and Warrington held his fire
for a few interminable seconds.</p>

<p>Then they closed in, and one stumbled
over Vicary's outstretched legs before they
could realise that two British officers were
within a yard of them. Warrington felt
the man grab at him as he fell, and fired
with the barrel of his revolver touching
bare skin. After that he fired and slashed
very much at random, and the darkness
around him shrieked and howled and spat
fire, and long graceful knives suggested
themselves to the imagination of the man
who had seen them at work before....
For ten long minutes Warrington was
busy&mdash;wondering all the time what Vicary
was doing down there between his legs,
and how he liked it, and which of them
would die first.</p>

<p>Then suddenly in a lull he heard faintly
a sound that sent the blood to his head
with a rush&mdash;the scraping of many boots
over rocks some hundreds of yards away,
and the dim echo of a word of command.
He shouted, and fired his last cartridge
above his head that they
might see the flash, and flung
the empty weapon at a white
eyeball that was too near to
be pleasant, and cut and
pointed and slashed away
with renewed vigour.
Down the valley
and over the
rocks came a hoarse,
breathless cheer, and
pith helmets gleamed
faintly in the near
distance. He answered
the cheer with a croak, and
went on carving and
hacking as though
his foes still confronted
him. But
they did not wait to
meet his friends.
They left. All but
five, to whom even
British troops were a matter of indifference
now, as they stayed behind, huddled into a
grim semicircle round Lieut. Warrington
and Second Lieut. Vicary. When his men
came up to him they found him with Vicary
in his arms leaning against the wall of
rock, "looking," as Private Billimore said,
"as though 'e'd 'ad a nasty messy accident
with the red paint."</p>

<p>Vicary opened his eyes as he entered
the camp feet foremost.</p>

<p>"Warrington, <i>V.C.</i>," he said, and tried
to cheer. But the others did it for him.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">(2) At Home.</h3>

<p>An afternoon in early November: a cosy
room, bright fire, big armchairs, piano,
pipes, photographs, and decanters: a male
figure extended to enormous length in one
armchair, with feet stretched out on the
hearthrug: another male figure with back
turned towards the room, gazing out of
window at the unceasing rain. Thick
clouds of tobacco smoke, and silence.</p>

<p>"Of all the brutal, filthy, miserably
depressing days!" said the man at the
window, suddenly.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus-0013.jpg" width="530" height="489" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"'I'M IN AN AWFUL FUNK,' SAID WARRINGTON."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Weather seems to worry you, old
man," said the gentleman by the fire,
settling down a little deeper into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
depths of his armchair. "Third time in
twenty minutes you've got up to look at it&mdash;and
talk about it."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Vic," said the other, and, turning,
he came slowly towards the fire. "I
must be lively company to-day; but this
weather seems to upset one altogether."</p>

<p>"Not me," said Vicary, blowing
a cloud. "I'm pretty
comfy, thanks. I prefer rain
in St. James' to starlight in
Chukundra."</p>

<p>The other did not answer,
but stood nervously opening
and shutting his hands over the
cheerful blaze.</p>

<p>"By George!" said Vicary,
meditatively, "it seems almost
like a dream now&mdash;all but
the souvenirs we carry&mdash;eh,
Warry?"</p>

<p>Warrington's hand went up
to the livid band that ran across
forehead, nose, and cheek, and
almost bisected his strong face.</p>

<p>"One comfort," Vicary went
on, "mine don't show. Not but
what that has its drawbacks,"
he added, with a chuckle; "no
one seems to believe they
touched me&mdash;think I got my
sick-leave on the bounce. And
I can't continually strip to
prove it."</p>

<p>Still his senior was silent. Vicary
edged round a little to look at his face.
Then his eyes opened and his voice
changed.</p>

<p>"Warrington," he said, "d'you remember
that very first dust up we had the
second day out from Kir Wallah?"</p>

<p>Warrington nodded.</p>

<p>"That was my first taste of the walk-up-and-down-as-a-target
business," said
Vicary, solemnly; "and I was in a blue
funk. Couldn't help it. Knees all flabby
and face all twitchy when those bullets
began whispering and pattering."</p>

<p>Warrington laughed nervously.</p>

<p>"I gave you the right sort of a dressing
down," he said.</p>

<p>"It pulled me through," said Vicary;
then, leaning forward, and still more
solemnly, "I say, what did I look like?&mdash;all
drawn up and ghastly?"</p>

<p>"A bit," admitted Warrington.</p>

<p>"Look in the glass now," said Vicary,
in an awestruck voice, for Warrington was
senior officer and brother and Ajax and
Wellington and Lord Roberts all rolled
into one, in the subaltern's estimation.</p>

<p>Warrington started, and looked not at
the glass, but at Vicary.</p>

<p>"You're right, young 'un," he said in a
moment, and dropped into the other armchair.
"I'm in an awful funk at this very
moment."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"'I SHOULD ADVISE YOU TO HAVE IT OUT WITH HER.'"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Oh!" breathed Vicary, and allowed
the amazing fact to sink into his consciousness.</p>

<p>"Fact," said Warrington, and dragged
at his moustache and gnawed the end.</p>

<p>"In heaven's name," said Ensign Vicary,
"what are <em>you</em> frightened of?"</p>

<p>"Of one little girl I could pick up and
carry under one arm," said Lieutenant
Warrington, V. C.</p>

<p>Vicary drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"You gave me quite a turn," he said.</p>

<p>"It's serious, boy," said the other man,
bending his long, gaunt body forward, his
grey eyes all alight. "I haven't the pluck
to face her."</p>

<p>"Name?" said Vicary, judicially.</p>

<p>"Rivers," said Warrington, with reverence;
"Catherine Rivers."</p>

<p>"Pretty Kitty Rivers!" cried Vicary.
"Old man, I congratulate you."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool!" said Warrington,
angrily, and walked to the window.</p>

<p>"On your good taste, of course," said
Vicary, with a grin. "Is it a bad case?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall&mdash;ask her to be my wife," said
Warrington with a rush, "as soon as I
dare call&mdash;which I haven't done since we've
been back&mdash;more than a week."</p>

<p>Vicary whistled, rose, and strolled over
to the piano.</p>

<p>"Well, I should advise you to go and
have it out with her," he said, twisting
himself round on the music-stool. "Come
back when it's over, and sparkle up a bit."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" growled his senior.</p>

<p>Vicary shrugged his shoulders and struck
a few aimless notes. This sort of timidity
was strange to him. In matters relating
to the opposite sex his senior was a child
compared with that good-looking boy at
the piano.</p>

<p>Suddenly Vicary grinned, struck a chord,
and broke into a music-hall song, accentuating
the twang of Cockayne to exaggeration:</p>

<div class="poetry-center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
</div>
<p>"Shakespeare" between
the shoulder-blades
cut his efforts short. He
twisted round, chuckling
and rubbing
himself.</p>

</div>

<p>"Steady on, old chap! What's up?"</p>

<p>"I came here to-day for your help," said
Warrington, and stopped short.</p>

<p>"Warry!" said Vicary, nervously. He
had never seen him like this before.</p>

<p>"Vic, I'm longing to see her&mdash;to say it!
I've been longing for months, and now&mdash;I
simply daren't call."</p>

<p>"Bulldog&mdash;heavy father&mdash;comic papers,"
murmured Vicary, quite uncomprehending.</p>

<p>Warrington glared.</p>

<p>"If you're going to be a drivelling young
idiot," he said, icily.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no! Drive ahead," said Vicary.</p>

<p>"It's just <em>her</em> I'm frightened of," said
Warrington. "I'd rather go through a
week of Chukundras than speak; but I'd
go through a lifetime of them with her at
the far end."</p>

<p>"But, Warrington," said Vicary, puzzled,
"she's not such a Tartar."</p>

<p>"She's the best girl in the world," said
Warrington, V.C.; "and the only thing in
it I'm afraid to face."</p>

<p>"Why, what would she do?" said
Vicary.</p>

<p>"Do?" said Warrington, with both
hands at his moustache. "Do? Why,
she'll drop her eyelashes, or she'll curl the
corners of her mouth, or she'll glance at
me over her shoulder with her chin up, and
then&mdash;and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then?" said Vicary, twinkling.</p>

<p>"Then I shall sweat like a coolie, and
stand gaping like a stuck pig," said Warrington,
savagely; "and my knees will go
flabby and my face twitchy, as you
elegantly put it. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"I'm going there now. I mean
to go there now."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Vicary; "and directly
you're outside you'll stand still for a
quarter of a hour, and then cut off
home and spend the evening practising
profanity in solitude."</p>

<p>Warrington stood in front of his
junior, and dared not contradict.</p>

<p>"Unless&mdash;&mdash;" said Vicary, and
stopped and grinned.</p>

<p>"Unless?" said Warrington, with
painful eagerness.</p>

<p>"Unless," said Vicary, coolly,
knocking his pipe out into the grate,
"unless I come with you."</p>

<p>Warrington drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said, shortly, and
watched Vicary putting on hat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
coat, and pulled his moustache violently.</p>

<p>As they left the room he slipped his
hand through Vicary's arm.</p>

<p>"This is my
Kir Wallah," he
said, gravely.</p>

<p>Vicary laughed
round at him.</p>

<p>"There's a
whacking big balance
on the Chukundra
side," he said.</p>

<p>"Needn't say
good-bye to the
mater," he went
on, as they descended
the
stairs; "you'll
come back to
dine."</p>

<p>"To be cheered
up," said
Warrington, with
pathos.</p>

<p>Vicary did not
deign to reply to
such an absurd
remark. He
hailed a hansom.</p>

<p>"Hadn't we
better&mdash;er&mdash;walk?"
said
Warrington, nervously.</p>

<p>"You jump
in," said Vicary;
"don't be frightened.
I'm coming
to hold your
hand."</p>

<p>He gave the
address, and they
bowled away
through the grey wetness. Warrington
was trying to see the whole of his person
at once in a six-inch strip of looking-glass.</p>

<p>"Now, I ask you, Vic," he said, plaintively,
"is it likely she'd have an object
like me?"</p>

<p>"Fishing!" said the subaltern. "You're
not an Adonis, but a V.C. covers a multitude
of sins."</p>

<p>"Pooh! what does a girl care about
that?" said Warrington; and Vicary
laughed aloud at him. To himself he said,
"The girl that gets you will get the
bravest, cleanest, best gentleman that wears
the Queen's uniform; and the girl that will
refuse you doesn't exist."</p>

<p>"Why, we're there," said Warrington,
flushing and fidgeting; "how that horse
has been going!"</p>

<p>"Three doors
down the square,"
said Vicary to the
cabman through
the trap.</p>

<p>"Tell him to
drive once round
first," said Warrington,
pulling a
glove off and then
beginning to put
it on again. "I&mdash;I've
got something
to say to
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It'll keep,"
said Vicary.
"Out you get."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I say&mdash;half
a minute.
Vicary! Is my
tie straight? I
ought to have
changed my collar.
Hang it&mdash;all
right, I'm
coming. Wait
for us, cabby&mdash;we
shan't be five
minutes. Vicary,
don't ring. I&mdash;I
don't think I'll
call to-day, after
all&mdash;it's a bit late,
don't you think?
You have rung?
Dash it! I&mdash;I&mdash;let
me ask." The
door was opened.
"Is Mr. Rivers
in? No? Oh, thank you. It don't
matter&mdash;I'll call again. Good&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Vicary caught him as he turned and

<p>"Is Miss Rivers in?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yessir," said the man, who knew him
well.</p>

<p>"Say Lieutenant Beverley Warrington
wishes to see her for a few moments on

<p>Inside the house Warrington mopped
his face and rehearsed speeches in a low
monotone until the man reappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you walk up, sir, please?"</p>

<p>"Walk up," said Vicary, sternly, and
marched him out of the room. "Right half
face! Quick march!
Go on, you conquering
hero, and good luck
attend you."</p>

<p>Warrington did
not answer, but
breathed stertorously
and fingered
the balustrade.</p>

<p>"Up you
go!" said Vicary.
"There's no retreat.
She's waiting for you."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wish you could
come too," said Warrington
in a loud, hoarse
whisper.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"HE FLEW UPSTAIRS AS

</div>

<p>Vicary grinned, shaking with internal
laughter. Warrington glared at him,
groaned, and went slowly upstairs, where
the man stood patiently waiting to announce
him.</p>

<p>Vicary heard him say breathlessly,
"Wait a minute"; but the man preferred
not to hear him, and opened the door with
a most portentous "Lieutenant Beverley
Warrington."</p>

<p>Vicary waited in the library. He
smoked one cigarette, and another,
and another. He tried to read, but
gave it up. He tried to laugh at
the scene in which he had just taken
part, but gave that up too. After
all, he was in no laughing mood
where Warrington's happiness was concerned.</p>

<p>And at last, when the hands of the clock
showed three-quarters of an hour gone,
Warrington's voice from upstairs called
hoarsely, "Vicary!"</p>

<p>He paused a moment, breathless.
Then another voice, far clearer and sweeter,
but with just a faint tremor in it, repeated,
"Vicary!"</p>

<p>And then he flew upstairs as fast as his
wound would allow him.</p>

DESCRIBED AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE LONDON BRIGADE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Alfred Arkas.</span></p>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">The</span> most fascinating of
the multitudinous institutions
with which the
Mother City of the Empire
abounds is unquestionably
that which preserves her
millions from the risk of
fire. In these days, when
we have awakened to a sense of appreciation
of the Navy, Army, and other national
institutions for our protection and well-being,
it is to be feared that we do not
sufficiently recognise the vast debt we owe
to the Metropolitan Fire Brigade and those
who rule its destinies.</p>

<p>London is to all intents and purposes an
impregnable city&mdash;impregnable, that is to
say, as regards an outside
foe. The possibility of internal
destruction by fire,
although by no means so
great as in the days of the
Great Fire of London,
still exists, in spite of fire-proof
buildings, stone
walls, and wide streets.
Although the possibility
exists, the risk of such a
catastrophe will not be
worth consideration so
long as the Metropolitan
Fire Brigade maintains its
present high state of efficiency.
It is to London
what the Fleet is to the
Empire, and the analogy is appropriate in
more respects than one. It may be aptly
described as the Navy of the Metropolis&mdash;the
protecting genius of six million people,
and the richest city the world has seen.
To adequately realise its importance one
has only to remember that the destruction
of London would be a calamity
to the Empire.</p>

<p>Every night its existence
is threatened by the
relentless fire demon. Every
night the Fire Brigade as
certainly combats and disarms
it. Surely a strange,
weird warfare, scarcely
realised, since it is only on
occasions when the demon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
temporarily gets the upper hand that we
are reminded of its existence.</p>

<p>Opportunities for the display of heroism
and conspicuous devotion to duty are comparatively
rare in the Army and Navy. So
when they occur we hear of them, and the
heroes are received with acclaim. In the
Fleet that never goes to sea such matters
are common incidents of the day's work.</p>

<p>It is part of the ordinary duty of a
London fireman to be a hero, and he
never fails when it is expected of him.</p>

<p>It is natural to think of the brigade as a
miniature Navy. It smells of the sea in
every way. The captain is a naval man.
Its crew of 1,009 are seamen,
and the work of the brigade
is of a nature readily
performed by sailors,
who are used to danger,
and skilled in
the art of hanging
on to the skyline
by their teeth.</p>

<p>Even the apparatus
is peculiarly
adapted
for the use of
the horny-handed
sons of the
sea.</p>

<p>It is therefore
easy to understand
how it is
that these well-disciplined,
hard-nerved
men are pressed into the service
of the brigade.</p>

<p>Many who have read of
the marvellous rapidity with
which the engines are turned
out to a fire, or those who have been
fortunate enough to see these splendid
fellows at their work, may be interested in
learning how a London fireman is made.</p>

<p>By the kindness of Commander Wells,
R.N.&mdash;one of the most popular officers
that ever donned the Queen's uniform&mdash;I
have been able to observe the whole
process, and pick up a good deal of interesting
matter respecting the brigade
into the bargain.</p>

<p>There is no objectionable formality about
entering the brigade. Provided a sailor
possesses the initial qualifications&mdash;he must
be over 21 and under 31 years of age; have
been at sea for at least five years; measure
37 inches round the chest; and be able to
read and write&mdash;he simply walks into the
yard of the central station at Southwark
and inquires for the chief officer. The
Commander examines his "discharges"
and testimonials as to character and general
intelligence. If he be a likely man, he
is passed into the hands of the Brigade
Doctor, who certifies his soundness of
wind and limb. If he emerges successfully
from this ordeal, he has yet a final
and more trying one before him&mdash;the test
of strength.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus-0019.jpg" width="530" height="474" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>TWO METHODS OF CARRYING&mdash;A WOMAN
OR A MAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sheer physical strength is a desideratum
in all branches of public service, but especially
so in the Fire Brigade, where
lives and property almost always
depend upon nerve
and muscle. Accordingly
the strength test
is necessarily a
heavy one. A fire
escape is brought
into the yard, and
is rested lengthwise
on the flagstones.
To a
ring-bolt in the
stones a tackle
is hooked, the
other end being
made fast to the
foot of the
escape. The
candidate is
then requested to haul
the escape bodily from
the ground into its
normal vertical position.
It is an immensely
trying pull of
240 lbs. If the candidate
manages it, he
becomes a probationer at a salary of 24<em>s.</em>
per week.</p>

<p>The Southwark instructors reckon that
it takes three months' hard work and unceasing
drill before a man is competent to
leave the yard, even as a fireman of the
fourth class. During this period he is
not permitted to attend a fire in any
capacity.</p>

<p>No other sort of drill equals in fascination
that which the embryo M.F.B. man
must go through. Unlike a soldier or sailor,
he must undertake many of the actual
dangers of warfare during ordinary drill on
the parade-ground. The instruction, conducted
by superintendents who have gone
through the mill themselves and know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
every detail of the work, is divided into
two parts&mdash;theoretical and practical.</p>

<p>The room in which most of the theory is
taught is particularly interesting. It contains
a half section of every apparatus or
device used by or in connection with the
brigade. There is a half section of the
boiler of the familiar steamer, a half section
of a street lamp, indicating the position of a
hydrant, and half sections of hose, nozzles,
fire-plugs, flanges, and all the complicated
machinery forming parts of the various
types of engines in use.</p>

<p>That very important part of instruction,
the use of steam, is undertaken in the yard,
so that practical demonstration with a
steamer under way may accompany the
lesson.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with theoretical instruction,
a daily grounding goes on in what
may be termed emergency drill. To the
layman, this is perhaps the most interesting
part of the work.</p>

<p>Everything must be rehearsed over
and over again. Every movement,
every action must be practised again
and again till it becomes automatic,
before a man can feel sure of doing
the right thing at the right time under
circumstances of difficulty and danger.
Most of us have seen a fireman descend
an escape, bearing on his back a
human burden, possibly heavier than
himself; we wonder how it is done, but
it does not occur to us that this same
evolution is practised every day at
Southwark in all its separate movements.</p>

<p>Our illustrations of this drill show
how a fireman is taught to lift and
carry a human body. In
the first picture, the men
under instruction are at
"Attention." The second
shows the first movement,
the body being lifted on to
its knees. In the third it is
raised to its feet. In the
final evolution the prostrate
figure is bodily lifted on to
the rescuer's back. The
whole operation scarcely
occupies a moment of time.
By this method, the strain
of lifting is reduced to a
minimum, and the position
of the body across the
shoulders leaves both hands
free.</p>

<p>When the men are thorough masters of
this lifting drill, they have to go through
the nerve-trying ordeal of performing it as
though in actual practice. Escapes are
run into the yard. Some of the old hands
mount to the roof, and the embryo firemen
are ordered to go aloft and save them from
an awful death. That this is a very considerable
feat, I think our photograph of
the operation will amply demonstrate. To
an old hand who has performed the operation
amid all the exciting surroundings of
an actual fire it is simple enough. He
skips up the creaking, bending ladder,
lightly tosses a twelve-stone colleague
on his back, in the most unconcerned
manner, and as blithely skips down
again.</p>

<p>But although there is an element of very
real danger in it to the beginner, yet he
generally gets through it satisfactorily,
though his progress is necessarily slow.
It is in such drills that his sea training
stands him
in good
stead.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>NERVOUS WORK FOR RECRUITS&mdash;NEW FIREMEN RESCUING OLD FIREMEN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>However,
the most
nerve-trying
work is the
jumping-sheet
drill.
As our illustration
shows,
some eighteen
or twenty
men at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
given order man the canvas jumping-sheet.</p>

<p>Beckets, or rope handles, are supplied
all round the edge of the sheet. Each
man holds one of these in either hand, and
as the jumper alights in the centre of the
canvas, all simultaneously give a little, and
so break the force of the fall. The men
are required to jump 20 feet from a parapet
into the sheet. It is nervous work, both
for the jumpers and those who catch
them.</p>

<p>The instructor
tells you that
there is no danger.
In fact a
forty-foot jump
into the sheet
would be very
unlikely to result
in injury.</p>

<p>It is easy to
listen to such
statements, but
it is another thing
to stand on that
narrow ledge and
gaze contemplatively
into the
tiny sheet, twenty
feet below.</p>

<p>Every possible
method of saving
life is the subject
of a special set
of drills, and all
are constantly
practised by all
hands alike.
They are designed
to meet every
possible contingency,
and when
lives are lost by
fire it is generally
attributable to delay in summoning the
brigade.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 340px;">

<div class="caption"><p>STILL MORE NERVOUS WORK&mdash;JUMPING-SHEET
DRILL, A 20-FEET DROP.</p></div>
</div>

<p>One of the most interesting systems of
rescue is that in which the chair knot is
used. It is an extreme method only
resorted to when the fierceness of the fire
renders the use of the escape impracticable.</p>

<p>This method is shown in actual operation
in one of our photographs. You are
invited to suppose that the whole face of
the building is alight, and that a person
is in the top front room calling for assistance.
Several men ascend to the roofs of the
houses on either side of the doomed building.
Each party has a rope, the two ends
of which are tied in a knot consisting of
two loops. The person in danger is instructed
how to fasten the loops about him.
He is now suspended in a sort of cradle or
chair, and is lowered away, a guy rope to
the ground controlling the angle of descent.</p>

<p>In some extreme cases where the chair
knot cannot be used another method is
resorted to. Several of the brigade ascend
to the roof of the opposite house with
a line. This has a knot similar to
that already described at one end,
and is swung or thrown across into
the window at which the unfortunate
individual stands. If this cannot be
managed the brigade use a special
rocket apparatus which enables them
to shoot a line to any given spot.</p>

<p>The man or woman, as the case
may be, gets into the knot and
swings off the window-ledge. The
rescue party know beforehand by
the length of the
line exactly
where he or she
will strike the
wall of the opposite
house, and
a mattress is suspended
at this
spot to break the
impact. At a
middle window a
long projecting
fork catches the
rope in the centre
as it swings across
the street,
and plays an important
part in
lessening the
shock to the
human burden in
the knot below.</p>

<p>Needless to say
there must always be an element of risk
in this method, and it is only resorted to
when every other expedient has failed.</p>

<p>New hands are constantly exercised in
the work of turning out, getting apparatus
to work, and performing in every detail the
duties likely to be met with at an ordinary
fire. There is a great deal of <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>
among them, and this and natural love of
competition soon place them on a footing
with the older hands as regards rapidity,
stability, and general smartness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Wednesday is the most interesting
day of the week. This is a sort of At
Home day at Southwark, and during the
afternoon all the drills are gone through
for inspection by the Commander. The
picturesque incident of this dress rehearsal
is the dummy fire. Without the slightest
warning the onlooker is startled by a shrill
whistle, the mad ringing of bells, and cries
of "Fire." From an upper story of one of
the buildings volumes of dense black smoke
pour forth, and before he has time to
realise that the whole thing is nothing
more than an elaborate rehearsal, a steamer
clatters into the yard, an escape is run up,
and the men are aloft with the hose. A
moment later two persons are rescued from
the burning room, the fire is got under, and
the brigade pack up their traps and disappear
as quickly as they came. The
photograph on the next page illustrates the
scene a few seconds after the first alarm.</p>

<p>This very realistic outbreak is produced
by means of a little oil and straw, ignited
in an alcove in the wall. The two men
who attend it have a lively time
between fire and water, and if
appearance counts for anything
they are not rescued a moment too
soon.</p>

<p>While one cannot but smile at
the humorous side of this mock
rescue, there is much of tragedy in
the actual work of this kind which
most members of the brigade are
called upon to perform at one time
or another.</p>

<p>I cannot help emphasising my
conviction that the brigade is taken
too much as a matter of course.
At all big fires some member of
the brigade is sure to receive injury;
this is amply proved by statistics.
For example, in 1897 the
number of accidents to members of
the brigade was 111. That is to
say, one man in ten received a
more or less serious hurt in the
execution of his duty. Fortunately,
no fatal case is reported.</p>

<p>In spite of this percentage the
men are the happiest of fellows.
They love and respect their Commander,
at which there is no
reason for surprise, and they go to
their duty cheerfully, no matter
what the danger or inconvenience
may be.</p>

<p>The most pathetic record of
heroism I know is that contained in a
corner cupboard of the Instruction Room.
Here are the helmets of men who have
died at their posts. In more cases than
one their lives have been sacrificed for
others.</p>

<p>Bent, battered, twisted, and torn into
every conceivable shape, they intimate only
too clearly the awful nature and suddenness
of such a death.</p>

<p>The appended label describes how every
man met his death. It is the story we
always hear of the British sailor, whether
he be afloat or ashore&mdash;blind, unfailing devotion
to duty, no matter how hopeless his
case.</p>

<p>The remnants of uniform and equipment
in the foreground of the picture are
all that was found of Jacobs, the poor
fellow who was burned like a rat in a hole
at the Wandsworth fire in 1889.</p>

<p>I will not enlarge upon this distressing
subject. They were grand fellows all of
them, worthy of our reverence and respect.</p>

<p>There are many more like them, and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
this gruesome illustration reminds our
readers that our firemen are every bit

</div>

<p>Improvements are constantly being
made in the apparatus of the brigade.
There is a tendency to do away with
the canvas shute once generally used
on fire escapes. Commander Wells
believes in ladders. He is striving
to horse all escapes, an advantage
which must strike the most casual
observer of fire brigade work. At the
present moment experiments are being
made with telephonic
street alarms. In the
ordinary street alarm
you smash the glass, press the button,
which rings a bell in the nearest station,
and wait till the engine comes. By the
new plan it will be possible to speak
directly through a telephone to the superintendent
of the nearest station&mdash;an enormous
advantage.</p>

<p>Needless to say the telegraphic and
telephonic arrangements of the brigade
are the most perfect in the world. One of
our illustrations shows the gigantic switchboard,
which directly connects the chief
officer with the sixty odd stations situated
all over London. The men at the tables
are engaged in receiving the daily reports
sent to the chief officer by the district
superintendents.</p>

<p>The canteen van is now taken to every
great fire. Formerly, when the men were
working drenched to the skin for twelve or
thirteen hours on end, they had no means
of obtaining much-needed refreshment.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>DUMMY FIRE AT HEADQUARTERS, WITH REAL SMOKE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Commander Wells has altered all that.
If the conflagration is one likely to keep
the brigade going for some hours, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>

</div>

<p>What a benefit this is only those who
have been on fire duty know.</p>

<p>Much more might be said of this, the
most interesting of our public services, but
my space is limited. I have not even
room to deal with the floating fire stations
and engines on the River Thames, worthy
in themselves of an article.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I
may tell those who
are fond of figures
that there are in the
service of the Metropolis
235 escapes,
59 steam fire engines,
70 manuals,
115 hose carts, 36
miles of hose, 8
steam tugs, 12
barges, 5 floating
stations, 8 floating
engines, 12 skiffs, 5
long fire ladders,
7 ladder vans, 156
watch boxes, 159
horses, 114 telephone
lines between stations,
592 fire alarm
call points, and a
host of other apparatus
too numerous
to mention.</p>

<p>The two most powerful steamers have a
capacity of 580 gallons per minute, the
ordinary engines 360
gallons per minute.</p>

<p>The horses are the
finest in the world, and,
as most people know,
they stand on duty
ready harnessed. The
weight of collar and
harness is taken off the
animals by means of a
mechanical contrivance
which swings upward
immediately the alarm
bell is rung.</p>

<p>In the superintendent's
room there is a
huge map of London.
It is dotted with little
spots coloured red,
green, and blue. The
red marks denote what
are called by the brigade
"working fires," <em>i.e.</em> where engines
have been used. The green spots indicate
small fires, and there are left a host of yellow
marks&mdash;in some districts there are
dozens within a few hundred yards of each
other.</p>

<p>I regret to say that they represent "malicious
false alarms." The punishment for
wilfully playing a trick of this kind is a
fine of £20 or three months' imprisonment.</p>

THE STORY OF A BIT OF DIPLOMACY.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Beatrice Heron-Maxwell.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Illustrated by Fred Pegram.</i></p>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illus-0025dc.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">"It</span> is like this, Frederic," said
the United States Minister,
button-holing Sir Frederic
Rawnsley, and leading him
to a deserted cosy-corner, "I
am in a nasty hole! It must
not be known, of course, but a
slip of paper containing some
important notes has got lost,
and I have a horrible misgiving
that it may have slipped inside the despatch
we have just sent to Lord Westfaling. It
won't do to ask, because it will only ensure
their attention being attracted to it if it's
there, and will betray our own laxity if it's
not. Yet it must be found. What would
you do?"</p>

<p>Sir Frederic thought for a moment;
under his trivial exterior were some brains,
as the Minister knew well.</p>

<p>"I should place the whole matter in the
hands of Berend," he said, decisively.</p>

<p>The Minister looked dissatisfied.</p>

<p>"A mere lad, and quite raw," he said;
"he has only been with us two days."</p>

<p>"I knew his father," continued Sir
Frederic; "one of the cleverest Secretaries
who ever handled a Legation. He would
have made his mark if he had not died too
soon. This boy is exactly like him. I
fancy he will do well."</p>

<p>Some guests were entering: a private
discussion was no longer possible. The
American Minister wandered away, still
dissatisfied and irresolute.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he crossed the ballroom,
with the young attaché at his heels,
and made his way to a girl in white, who
was the centre of attraction there.</p>

<p>"You are interested in diplomacy, Lady
Anstiss," he said; "may I present to you
our latest arrival, Mr. Julius Berend?&mdash;Lady
Anstiss Carlyon."</p>

<p>The girl raised a pair of lovely, indifferent
eyes, and bowed; the Minister moved away
as though the introduction were a matter
of casual insignificance.</p>

<p>A few steps further on he stopped and
glanced back.</p>

<p>Mr. Berend, his face devoid of expression,
though he had just been introduced to
the most beautiful girl in Brussels, was
looking down silently.</p>

<p>Lady Anstiss, her shoulder turned to
him, was bestowing her slow, sweet smile,
the smile that had already made her famous
as a beauty, on someone in the distance.</p>

<p>"What stage of acquaintanceship must
one reach," he said, gravely, "before being
promoted to the honour of a smile from
Lady Anstiss Carlyon?"</p>

<p>She looked a little annoyed.</p>

<p>"Some people never reach it," she answered;
"the majority in fact. I reserve it
for my personal friends&mdash;and they are few."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," said Mr. Berend.
"I hate majorities: to escape from them is
something worth striving for. To me a
barrier of any sort is delightful; it arouses
a corresponding amount of energy; and
indolence is my detestation and my failing
at the same time."</p>

<p>Lady Anstiss made a little gesture of
impatience. This sententious boy was
going to be a bore, and to give her the
trouble of crushing him. Her programme,
dangling from her fan, attracted his attention;
he raised it and took the pencil, saying,
"May I have the pleasure? Which dance?"</p>

<p>There were still two vacant places on the
card; Lady Anstiss did not intend them
for a chance-comer.</p>

<p>"I am sorry&mdash;&mdash;" she began; but quite
courteously he interrupted her.</p>

<p>"I should have preferred a waltz," he
said; "but I am fortunate to find you disengaged
at all," and wrote his name down.</p>

<p>Lady Anstiss looked at him critically as
he did so.</p>

<p>A young man of middle height, with a
graceful figure, and a face that might be
called blameless, so inoffensive were the
features and colouring. Fair, youthful-looking,
with an air of mild freshness about
it that seemed peculiarly unsuited to his
profession. A partner claimed Lady Anstiss
before she had made up her mind precisely
how to subdue this apparently unconscious
offender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lord Westfaling is still away, and
can't have had your despatch yet; so if
Berend can get round Lady Anstiss," said
Sir Frederic Rawnsley, with oracular significance,
a little later, "the thing might
be worked somehow."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 416px;">
<img src="images/illus-0026.jpg" width="416" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>'YOU ARE INTERESTED IN DIPLOMACY, LADY ANSTISS. MAY I PRESENT TO YOU OUR LATEST
ARRIVAL?' SAID THE AMERICAN MINISTER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The American Minister shook his head.</p>

<p>"If!" he repeated. "There is a very
wide margin for probability, I am
afraid."</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Sir Frederic.
"Women move the levers nowadays,
though men make 'em. Westfaling gives
in to her in everything. If she so insisted on
his retiring from political life to-morrow,
he would do it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, and in spite also of the
fact that Lady Anstiss was dancing for
the second time that night with Mr. Berend,
the Minister still felt as hopeless at the
conclusion of the Diplomatic Ball as he
had at its commencement.</p>

<p>The day following the ball happened to
be the occasion of a weekly reception at
Lord Westfaling's, where the part of
hostess was played by his only daughter,
Lady Anstiss Carlyon. She was at home
from four to seven, and it was as the clock
struck the former hour that her first visitor
was announced&mdash;Mr. Julius Berend.</p>

<p>She had parted from him the night before
still undecided as to the precise nature
and extent of his offence, and the precise
measure of punishment. His presumption
appeared to be involuntary, as in the case
of his calling so early&mdash;a privilege he ought
to have hesitated to take.</p>

<p>She greeted him with the faintest perceptible
effort of memory, as though she
hardly recalled who Mr. Julius Berend
was; but he was so little disconcerted that
the reproof was wasted, and he took the
chair nearest to her, which was unnecessary.
She felt, in the few moments' conversation
that ensued, as though she were
a skilled fencer foiling the aimless thrusts
of a tyro who did not know he was fencing.</p>

<p>Presently she handed him some tea, and
in accepting it he calmly detained her
fingers with his left hand.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," he said, "is that a genuine
scarabæus in your ring? If so, it is a very
perfect specimen."</p>

<p>"My father gave it to me," she said,
coldly, "and he believes it to be a real
one, but I cannot answer for its genuineness."</p>

<p>She attempted to withdraw her fingers;
really, this young man was impossible.</p>

<p>But he still held them with firm gentleness,
and having placed his cup of tea on
a table, he now ventured to touch the ring
with his right forefinger.</p>

<p>"Singular!" he said. "I thought I
knew the genus scarabæus fairly well, but
I do not remember seeing an intaglio quite
like this before. May I&mdash;&mdash;" He was about
to draw the ring off.</p>

<p>"I would rather not," Lady Anstiss said,
hastily, while his audacity brought the
slightest addition of rose-flush to her cheek.
"My father placed the ring there himself
on my last birthday."</p>

<p>Again she strove to release her hand,
and her eyes&mdash;grey eyes, with depths of
violet in them&mdash;darkened with surprised
vexation.</p>

<p>This young man seemed incapable of
appreciating his own transcendent presumption.
He was still replacing the ring,
when the door, opening wide and swiftly,
disclosed another visitor.</p>

<p>"Lady Lomond!" announced the footman;
and a Scotchwoman, of ready eye
and potent tongue, entered. The hand of
Lady Anstiss was her own again simultaneously;
but she rose to greet the newcomer
with an uncomfortable sensation of
having been caught and compromised.</p>

<p>Her hope that the situation had escaped
Lady Lomond's notice was shattered with
the first words.</p>

<p>"Palmistry?" inquired that lady, briefly,
with a glance at Mr. Berend.</p>

<p>Lady Anstiss smiled with outward composure,
but with inward rage.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she said; "this is Mr.
Berend, who is learned in Egyptian lore,
and doubts the quality of my scarabæus."</p>

<p>But even as she said it, she rebelled
against all that her words must imply.</p>

<p>It would seem to Mr. Berend that she
was acknowledging his right to have held
her hand, to have behaved in fact unpardonably;
that she was mitigating, explaining,
condoning the offence all in one
breath, and leaguing herself, as it were,
with him against any insinuations that
Lady Lomond might make.</p>

<p>Whether Mr. Berend perceived the situation
or not it was impossible to tell.</p>

<p>He handed some tea to Lady Lomond,
made one of his subtly inane remarks, and
took his leave, saying, as he bowed over
Lady Anstiss's hand, which he pressed
more closely than the farewell warranted&mdash;</p>

<p>"I should like to feel quite certain about
that scarabæus. Perhaps you will let me
examine it again at leisure another day;
it is exceedingly interesting to me."</p>

<p>And under the watchful eyes of the most
ruthless scandal-promoter in Brussels,
Lady Anstiss was obliged to assent, to
appear quite friendly and at ease with him,
when all the time she felt every word he
uttered as a fresh provocation.</p>

<p>"Quite new, is he not?" said Lady
Lomond; "that is, out here, I mean. An
old friend of yours, no doubt?" Which
was embarrassing when Lady Anstiss was
secretly making up her mind to cut him
dead from that moment.</p>

<p>The door reopened before she answered,
and Mr. Berend was back again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"I forgot," he said, "I am the bearer of
a message to Lord Westfaling. Might I
give it to him personally?"</p>

<p>"My father is away for three days," replied
Lady Anstiss; "I thought General
Standish was aware of that."</p>

<p>She intended a reproof, and this time
Mr. Berend did not ignore it.</p>

<p>"Quite so," he answered; "my message
was not from my chief; it was of a more
private nature. Perhaps I might be permitted
to have Lord Westfaling's address,
or if I might send a note here could it be
forwarded?"</p>

<p>"We are not forwarding any letters to
him this time; they would only have
missed him, perhaps," she answered, "but
if you write here he will receive it on
arrival."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Mr. Berend, laconically,
and took his final departure.</p>

<p>For thirty-six hours Lady Anstiss did
not see him again, and during that period,
in the intervals between her social distractions,
the thought of him recurred so often
that at last she positively wished to see
him. She intended to show him plainly
that he had transgressed, that she was
not to be approached in the easy fashion
he had adopted, and that the idea of friendship
between them was quite out of the
question.</p>

<p>She meant, in fact, to snub him as never
had any young rising diplomat been snubbed
before.</p>

<p>Armed with these pleasant resolutions,
she felt really gratified when, at a dinner
to which she had gone under Lady
Lomond's chaperonage, she found that
Mr. Berend was sitting on her left
hand.</p>

<p>She was fully prepared for any advances
he might make, and it took her some
time to realise that he was evidently not
going to make any at all.</p>

<p>He acknowledged her presence with
polite gravity, and thereafter devoted
himself to the lady on his other side,
taking part also in the general conversation
at table, and taking it well,
but never once addressing a remark to
Lady Anstiss.</p>

<p>She found herself listening to his
conversation, acknowledging with
unwillingness
that it was
clever, and betrayed
no immaturity
such as
his face suggested;
finally she
began to feel
piqued that he
should ignore
her, and to think
that if Lady
Lomond noticed
it, that good lady
would be sure to
weave a new
romance from
his conduct.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 449px;">
<img src="images/illus-0028.jpg" width="449" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HE CALMLY DETAINED HER FINGERS WITH HIS LEFT HAND."</p></div>
</div>

<p>After dinner
the same thing
occurred. Mr.
Berend, without
seeming to do so
in any marked
manner, contrived
to avoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
her, and, strange to say, this chafed her,
although she was surrounded all the
evening by other men.</p>

<p>It vexed her, too, that Mr. Berend should
appear to be concentrating himself on Lady
Lomond, and Lady Anstiss wondered that
he should be content to listen to such
lengthy discourse from a woman who was
nothing if she was not gossiping.</p>

<p>She felt a sort of relief when at last
the moment for departure came, and, passing
Mr. Berend with the slightest bow as he
held the door open, swept downstairs in a
less equable frame of mind than was her
wont. To her surprise, when she followed
Lady Lomond down the steps to the
carriage, Mr. Berend, running lightly after
them, jumped in too.</p>

<p>"I asked Mr. Berend to come with us,"
said Lady Lomond, "because if you do
not mind I should like you to drive me
home first, and I thought he could then
escort you on to the Rue de la Place."
The smile which accompanied this remark
conveyed that she thought she had done a
very clever and acceptable thing in giving
these two an opportunity for a <em>tête-à-tête</em>.</p>

<p>"Thanks," responded Lady Anstiss,
stiffly, "but I am afraid that will be taking
Mr. Berend quite out of his way; and I
am accustomed to drive alone often."</p>

<p>The matter, however, appeared to be
settled, and she could only invoke silent
anathemas on Lady Lomond's head for her
officiousness, and determine that she would
match Mr. Berend in behaviour, and would
ignore him even when they were left to
each other's society. But she reckoned
without her host.</p>

<p>For, the moment after Lady Lomond
had entered her own house and the carriage
had started again, Mr. Berend, calmly
taking the vacant place beside Lady
Anstiss, said in an earnest tone, quite
different from his usual one&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have longed for and yet dreaded this
moment. Lady Anstiss, I felt to-night
that there was only one subject I could
speak to you about, and that I did not
care to touch on it in the presence of
others. It is a matter of indifference to
you, but to me it is not only a serious one&mdash;it
is a very distressing one."</p>

<p>He paused; and she tried to remember
some of the chill and cutting remarks
with which she had intended to show him how
great was the distance that divided them.</p>

<p>But she had been wholly unprepared for
this new method of advance, and, as only
irrelevant replies occurred to her, she contented
herself with silence.</p>

<p>"I am going away," he continued, "to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Going away," she echoed, involuntarily;
"you have only just come. How is that?"</p>

<p>"I have pledged myself to fulfil a certain
task in a certain space of time; the
time ends to-morrow morning, and the task
is uncompleted. Therefore I shall leave
Brussels in the afternoon. Failure is quite
as insupportable to me as to those above
me. But I should not mind it so much if
it were not for two things."</p>

<p>Again he paused, and again she was
silent. They were nearing the Rue de la
Place now; he knew that a few moments
more only remained to him.</p>

<p>"You do not ask what they are," he
said, with reproach, "and you will probably
add it to my other iniquities if I tell you.
Yet, Lady Anstiss, I must tell you."</p>

<p>His manner was strangely eager; she
wished that she could feel more annoyed at
it than she did.</p>

<p>"One reason is because when I leave
Brussels I feel like the moth who goes out
into the dark night and who longs to be
fluttering his wings still round the light
that dazzled him, that would have scorched
him if he could have reached it. And the
other&mdash;may I tell you the other?"</p>

<p>"You have not waited for my permission
so far," she answered, half petulantly, half
relentingly.</p>

<p>"There is no time to wait," he said;
"the other is that I have added to my
failure an unnecessary piece of stupidity
which I deplore, and which is all the more
aggravating because it is not yet irretrievable."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Berend?" Her
voice sounded softened even to herself; yet
she had not quite intended it.</p>

<p>"I mean that it is in your power to do me
an inestimable service; to soften my disgrace,
and give me, in fact, another chance
with the powers that be. I wrote a note&mdash;the
note of which I spoke to you&mdash;to
your father, on a private matter; and at
the same time I was copying an important
and strictly private paper for my chief. An
important and strictly private paper is now
missing, and the question is, could it by
any carelessness have been placed in the
envelope directed to Lord Westfaling. If
so&mdash;&mdash;" He made an expressive gesture of
hopelessness.</p>

<p>"But what can I do?" She looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
him in real astonishment. This strange
young man had the faculty of exciting
interest, certainly, as well as displeasure.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 530px;">

<div class="caption"><p>"'IT IS IN YOUR POWER TO
SOFTEN MY DISGRACE.'"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"You can allow me to open my own
letter&mdash;in your presence&mdash;to seal it up
again, after taking out the accidental enclosure
if it is there, and so to retrieve what
will otherwise be a very disastrous piece of
bad luck."</p>

<p>"I do not see how it would be possible
for me to do this," she said, after a moment's
thought; "my father returns at ten
to-morrow; I should find it difficult to explain
it to him, to give him a sufficient
reason for having ventured to interfere
with his letters."</p>

<p>"If you would allow me to call and say
good-bye to you at a quarter to ten,"
he pleaded, "in any case it would be a
favour that I should prize immensely, and it
is the last I shall ever ask of you."</p>

<p>It was extraordinary! This was in
reality only the third time she had seen
him, yet he was speaking to her with all
the force and fervour of a long-tried
lover.</p>

<p>And the amazement she felt at him was
equalled by that which she felt at herself;
for, to her own surprise, she was neither
indifferent nor
resentful.
There was a
magnetic force
about him
which carried
all before it.
They had
turned into
the Rue de la
Place; a moment
more
and they must
part.</p>

<p>"A mere
formal visit of
farewell," Mr.
Berend urged.
"Lady Anstiss,
you do
not know what
it means to
me, or you
would not
hesitate. It is
not only my
career&mdash;it is
my life!"</p>

<p>The carriage
had stopped&mdash;the footman had opened the
door; before she had time to answer, Mr.
Berend had descended and was handing
her out.</p>

<p>"Then I will call shortly before ten to-morrow,"
he said, in a clear voice, "to see
if you have any messages for England.
Good night, Lady Anstiss."</p>

<p>He was away up the street, and she was
in her own boudoir before she realised that
she had tacitly granted his request.</p>

<p>And the feeling of annoyance with him
that had been hers a few hours before
was gone; in its place was one of pity for
this daring young man whose essay in
diplomacy had come to an untimely end.</p>

<p>He was of course nothing&mdash;less than
nothing to her, but it would seem too
unkind to refuse to see him in the
morning.</p>

<p>She went to sleep at last, still undecided
as to what she would or would not do.</p>

<p>But Mr. Julius Berend was troubled by
no misgivings, and when he presented himself
at a quarter to ten the next morning, a
flicker of satisfaction tempered the pensive
sadness of his gaze.</p>

<p>She was in the garden, and as he
stepped out through the French windows
towards her he thought&mdash;as he had thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
on the night of his introduction to her&mdash;that
for such a face as this, and such a
smile, he would go to the end of the world.</p>

<p>And she? A grave sweetness had taken
the place of her
former manner to
him, and she said,
after giving him her
hand, "Mr. Berend,
I have been thinking
over what you
asked me, and&mdash;I
think I can make
it right with my
father. You will
promise me, of
course, not to take
anything out of the
letter that ought to
remain there?"</p>

<p>"I promise," he
answered, quietly.</p>

<p>They went into
the library together,
and she brought
him the tray of
letters that were
awaiting Lord
Westfaling's arrival.</p>

<p>He drew a long
envelope from his
pocket, an official one, already addressed
to Lord Westfaling.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 211px;">
<img src="images/illus-0031.jpg" width="211" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"A LOOSE PAPER FLUTTERED
TO THE FLOOR."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"It matches this," he said, "the one I
want to open."</p>

<p>There were two similar envelopes
amongst the pile of correspondence. He
selected one, opened it, and, taking out the
contents, shook them, stooped to pick up a
loose paper that fluttered from them to the
floor, and then placed them in the fresh
envelope he had brought.</p>

<p>"May I seal this?" he asked. He had
brought an official seal with him.</p>

<p>She brought him sealing wax and taper.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said, when this was
finished. "The paper was there, as I
thought. I am glad to have retrieved it."</p>

<p>He folded it up, and put it, with the old
envelope, into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Good-bye." He was holding out his
hand to her quite coolly.</p>

<p>She felt hurt, disappointed. She would
have deprecated his gratitude for the service
she had rendered him, but the absence
of its expression chilled her.</p>

<p>"Good-bye." She gave him her hand.</p>

<p>He clasped it for an instant, then raised
it, saying, "We did not settle the vexed
question of the ring. I am inclined, now I
see it again, to think it is a genuine old
scarabæus."</p>

<p>A sudden access of shyness, strange and
new, came to her. The coldness of his
voice did not match the warm clasp of his
hand, the nearness of his approach.</p>

<p>She felt that the colour was mounting to
her cheeks, and turned her face aside to
hide it. And the next instant she felt the
touch of his lips on her hair just where
it swept away from her white neck.</p>

<p>"Mr. Berend!" she said, breathlessly,
and would have started away, but he still
held her hand.</p>

<p>"You can either never forgive me," he
said, quickly, "or you must do so fully
and freely. There can be no half measures
between us any longer."</p>

<p>She was speechless; a storm of mixed
feelings possessed her.</p>

<p>"I set myself to win you from the first
moment that I saw you," he continued,
impetuously. "The other task was nothing.
I determined it should be both or
neither with me. The failure that I spoke
of to you last night is redeemed, and I am
no longer under a cloud. It was a question
of my word, and I have kept it. But
for you I should not have done so. My
fate is in your hands entirely."</p>

<p>Still no answer.</p>

<p>He drew her a little closer. "I have
seen you four times," he went on, "and
each time I have said to myself, 'There is
only one woman in the world for me, and
she is so sweet and lovely and perfect, that
I dare only say good-bye to her&mdash;unless
she tells me to stay.' Anstiss, good-bye!"</p>

<p>There was a stir in the house, and steps
approaching in the hall. Lord Westfaling
had returned, and was coming to the
library. Mr. Berend released the hand
he held, and Lady Anstiss turned in confusion
to greet her father at the door.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Berend, of the United
States Embassy, father," she said. "He
has brought a letter for you. It is there
amongst your other ones."</p>

<p>She could not look at him; she was still
in a tumult of indecision. Mr. Julius
Berend had shaken hands with her father,
apologising for his early call, and was saying
to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going to town this afternoon on
business. May I call again at a more
opportune moment on my return?"</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes to his, and he saw
that he had won her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she said, simply; and with a
bow he was gone.</p>

<p>"A nice-looking young fellow," commented
her father, leisurely turning over
his letters. "Son of Max Berend, I suppose.
Very clever and smart, I am told."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I told you you could not do better than
pin your faith on Berend," said Sir Frederic
Rawnsley to the United States Minister, a
few days afterwards. "He managed that
little affair for you very cleverly; and
seems to be managing another little affair
very cleverly, too."</p>

<p>He put up his eyeglass to watch the
greeting between Mr. Julius Berend and
Lady Anstiss Carlyon.</p>

<p>"Lady Lomond tells me it is almost a
settled thing," he remarked. "And, after
all, Anstiss might do a good deal worse.
Berend will never stop half way; he is
bound to reach the top of the tree."</p>

<h2><a name="PHOTOGRAPHIC_LIES" id="PHOTOGRAPHIC_LIES">PHOTOGRAPHIC LIES.</a><br />

PROVING THE USELESSNESS OF THE CAMERA AS A WITNESS.</h2>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a popular notion abroad that
the art of photography is a first
cousin to George Washington, and cannot
tell a lie. The wider knowledge of the art,
due to its adoption by hundreds of thousands
of amateurs as a hobby, has largely
shown the fallaciousness of this belief. Yet
photographic fakes of a most absurdly
simple nature still continue to impose upon
the credulity of thousands of people, among
the number being many who have gone so
far as to accept such inventions as irrefutable
evidence, in their ignorance of the
possibilities of this, perhaps, the most elastic
of all arts.</p>

<p>A striking instance of this is seen in the
so-called "spirit" photographs, published
some years ago by Mr. W. T. Stead. The
brilliant editor of the <cite>Review of Reviews</cite>, a
deep believer in spirit manifestations,
argued that these photographs afforded the
most conclusive proofs of the playful habit
spooks have of returning to the scenes of
their earthly labours.</p>

<p>He said that they were on the photographic
plate, and, that being so, they
must have been there "in the flesh," or
"in the fog," as Mark Twain has it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this apparently conclusive
argument was completely upset by
Mr. Labouchere, who possessed a greater
knowledge of the ways of photographs and
photographers than his colleague, and explained
how it was done.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the photographic
ghost is an easily explained phenomenon,
and any amateur can turn out creepy
spooks by the thousand at the expense of
a little time and patience.</p>

<p>A photograph is absolutely inadmissible
as evidence of anything, unless it is proved
conclusively that it was in nowise faked
after being taken.</p>

<p>The faking can be carried on almost to
any extent. In fact, nothing is impossible
to the clever knight of the camera.</p>

<p>If a photographer wished to show that
you were in a particular street at a certain
time, he could do it with the greatest ease,
notwithstanding that you were a thousand
miles away at the moment in question.</p>

<p>If he wished to prove that your dog or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
pony had trespassed on his flowerbeds, it
would be a simple matter to do so, and if
cleverly done I doubt if the "fake" could
be detected.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A GHOST WHICH WAS NOT A GHOST.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Anyway, I have seen many faked photographs
that experienced photographers
themselves were at a loss to explain.</p>

<p>In this article I propose to give some examples
of extraordinary faked photographs,
and explain to some extent how they are
done. In each case they have been specially
prepared for the illustration of this article,
and amateur photographers who read this
might do worse than copy them.</p>

<p>Many of these required considerable
technical skill and inventive resource.</p>

<p>These qualities are exhibited to a high
degree in the illustration of the railway in
Holborn, for while we are glad that an
electric train is to run <em>under</em> Holborn, no
living or dead man has ever seen a train in
Holborn itself. Such fakes occupy a considerable
time in manufacture.</p>

<p>While the explanation is simple, the
carrying out of this fake was a matter of
some difficulty.</p>

<p>First a picture of a railway junction
was taken. Then it was necessary to take
a photograph of Holborn. This in itself is
a simple enough matter, but in this case it
was necessary to obtain a picture of exactly
the same scale, in order that the railway
lines might be fitted to appear as a natural
part of the picture.</p>

<p>This was only managed after several ineffectual
shots. Then the latter negative
was placed in the printing frame with the
roadway masked. When sufficiently printed
the railway negative was placed in the
frame on the same paper. That part of
Holborn already printed was masked, and
thus the rails were printed in the space
where the roadway should have been. The
result will make Londoners rub their eyes.</p>

<p>The two ghost photographs are specially
calculated to puzzle not a few who are
unacquainted with the tricks of the art.
Like most puzzling things, they are simplicity
itself when explained. There is not
a suspicion of mystery about them. By
the same method any amateur may manufacture
a whole gallery of family ghosts for
his delectation.</p>

<p>The invocation of our ghosts was on
this wise.</p>

<p>A nice, quiet, suitable sort of churchyard
not a dozen miles from London
was chosen, and, with a couple of assistants,
I hied myself to it one bright and
anything but ethereal morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>First, the lady was posed till we were
satisfied that she looked scared enough for
a ghost to be turned on. A second later
my other assistant, with the best dining-room
tablecloth thrown over his head,
came on the scene, glided with healthy
earthly steps to a pre-arranged spot, and
took up his position.</p>

<p>Snap went the pneumatic shutter. The
photographic plate, one of an extremely
rapid variety, was exposed for the space of
a second, and the ghost hid himself behind
the camera and took off his tablecloth.
The lady meanwhile remained in the same
position, and directly the ghost disappeared,
snap went the shutter again on
her. So in the interval of nine seconds
this wonder was perpetrated.</p>

<p>Those who have not dabbled in photography
will require a further explanation of
the need of two exposures of the same plate.
In the first place, then, I assume that
everybody knows that a photograph is the
result of light acting on a glass plate
coated with a sensitive preparation. When
the photographer says, "Now then, a
smile, please. Thank you. Steady," you
may have noticed
that he touches
an indiarubber
ball. This is a
pneumatic
release, which
momentarily exposes
the plate to
the light. In that
brief period the
light eats or rots
the sensitive
material, at the
same time faithfully
imprinting
upon it an exact
image of whatever
may be
before it.</p>

<p>Now the whole
secret of successful
photography
may be said to
depend on this
exposure being of
the right length.
If it is too short,
the light has insufficient
time to
clearly impress
the plate with
the picture.
If it is too long, the image will be too
dense.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/illus-0036.jpg" width="375" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>PROVING A MAN TO BE TRANSPARENT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>So much technique is necessary to a
proper explanation of ghost pictures. Now
the one second exposure given to our friend
the ghost was much too short a time in
which to obtain a good portrait of him, but
quite long enough to obtain a faint shadowy
image, which was just the thing desired.</p>

<p>On obtaining this he quietly walks out
of the picture, and we then open the plate
for another eight seconds, which is just
long enough to obtain a clear and normal
photograph of the rest of the picture, including
the startled sitter, who has not
moved in the meantime. And what is of
still greater importance, it gives sufficient
time for the foliage and end of the seat to
impress themselves through the first
picture, and so produce that shadowy
transparent texture beloved of all aristocratic
varieties of the ghost species.</p>

<p>The tombstone spirit was produced in
the same way, a second exposure being
given to the tomb, the grass, and the ivy-covered
wall behind.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the ghost picture is
a particularly
simple example of
the "fake" photograph.</p>

<p>In the beginning
of this article
I spoke of the
futility of admitting
the photograph
as evidence.</p>

<p>To prove my
assertion, I have
been at some
pains to prepare
a faked photograph
that will
show how a subject
might be
"doctored" and
put in as conclusive
proof.</p>

<p>I have assumed,
for the purpose
of this example,
that a prisoner
charged
with an offence,
say in the North
of England, has
sought to set up
an alibi by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
producing a portrait of a street in which he
himself is seen. For the sake of argument,
we will say that the photograph was taken
by a friend who is prepared to swear that
the picture was made on the day of the
crime. Supposing this to be the case, if
the photograph were accepted as evidence
it would undoubtedly be instrumental in
getting the accused off.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus-0037.jpg" width="530" height="351" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>SHOWING HOW A MAN CAN BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now such a picture might readily be
faked so as to deceive the most experienced.
In order to realise this, you have only to
glance at the photograph on this page.</p>

<p>The scene is a street at Richmond, and
in the foreground two men are standing.
If you look at them for a moment you will
observe that they are in reality one and the
same person. As we have not yet discovered
a method of creating a double, it
is perfectly clear that one at least of these
figures has been "faked" or printed into the
original photograph, and I don't know that
it is very clear which.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the one on the left-hand
side was taken in the original picture,
and the other is faked. Two figures of the
same individual are shown, because, had we
published one, and stated that the other
was "printed in," it is possible some people
might question the statement.</p>

<p>As it is, the duplicate clinches the matter,
and the obvious deduction is that if one
photograph can be faked in this manner, so
can another.</p>

<p>However, we doubt if photographers,
amateur or otherwise, were ever guilty of
using their knowledge of fakes for any
purpose other than that of amusement, and
that indeed was our idea in shedding light
on this comparatively unknown subject.</p>

<p>By the simple expedient of faking in the
printing operation you may do what you
will with friend or foe.</p>

<p>Cecil Rhodes may shake hands with
Oom Paul, and the nation may be persuaded
that they have forgotten their little
amenities. It is only necessary to obtain
suitable photographs of the two, the rest is
comparatively simple.</p>

<p>The figure in the bottle would in the
middle ages have burned its creator at
the stake, but there is no witchcraft in it
in reality. Indeed, it is one of the simplest
photographic freaks to produce. In this
case the figure is printed somewhat deeply
on paper in the usual way, except that a
mask of paper is cut to fit all round it to
keep the remaining portion of the sensitive

the printing-frame, then placed behind a
negative of the bottle, and a light print is
made, with the result that the effect shown
in the illustration is produced.</p>

<p>Few, save those who have had practice
in instantaneous photography, realise the
enormous rapidity necessary to the successful
portraying of rapid movement by means
of the camera.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting experiments
in trick photography is that devoted to the
evolving of composite portraits. The production
of a successful composite practically
means the creation of a new face.
The method is similar to that employed in
the making of ghost pictures. It is necessary
to obtain, say, four portraits&mdash;the
more used the greater the difficulty. These
are all photographed one over the other on
the same plate. The difficulty consists in
regulating the exposures, that photographed
first requiring a longer exposure than the
next, and so on through the series. The
example we give is a composite of photographs
of well-known actors, and the face
contains portraits of Sir Henry Irving and
Mr. Forbes Robertson.</p>

<p>The composite photograph has been of
great scientific value in determining the
characteristic predominant features of different
types of physiognomy. Our illustration
is an excellent example of the typical
actor's face.</p>

<p>A well-known professor recently composed
a series of these types. One was a
face containing the portraits of twelve
eminent mathematicians; another contained
portraits of sixteen notable naturalists.</p>

<p>Very extraordinary photographic freaks
often result from mere accident. On the
next page is given a picture of Hastings
pier in a storm. A very good negative
was obtained in the first instance, but unfortunately
when developed it was placed
on the oven to dry. The heat contracted
the sensitive film of the negative, and when
printed it presented the curious appearance
seen in the illustration.</p>

<p>As a picture of a storm it is splendid,
surpassing in exaggeration anything ever
invented by the resourceful Munchausen.</p>

</div>

<p>"A Study in Boots" is an excellent
example of one of the most effective
methods of photographic faking. Like
many things which border on the marvellous,
it is as simple as A B C. The explanation
is that when taking the photograph
the operator used a short focus lens
and made a point of specially focussing the
boots instead of the picture as a whole.
The result was that the rest of the figure
was thrown out of focus, and consequently
out of proportion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>This effect is only too well known to
most beginners in the art, for it often
appears unbidden in their early efforts,
to the utter ruin of an otherwise good
picture. Amateurs
frequently
spoil portraits of
their friends in
this way, the
feet or hands appearing
treble
their proper size
in the picture.
The defect is usually
the result of
working with a
lens of too short
a focus. This
explanation is
somewhat technical
for those
who have not
embraced the
fascinating art,
but it cannot be put in any other
way.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 530px;">

<div class="caption"><p>HASTINGS PIER WHEN SUFFERING FROM HEAT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There are many other possibilities in
photographic faking. In fact, an amateur
of an inventive disposition may evolve
them <i lang="la">ad libitum</i>.</p>

<p>For example, there is the "long and
short of it" style of fake, that will surely
result in much amusement. By the use of
concave and convex mirrors the face of a
friend may be abnormally lengthened or
widened in the portrait until it reminds
one of the pictures displayed outside eating-houses,
bearing
the inscriptions,
"Before dining at
Z&mdash;&mdash;'s," "After
dining at
Z&mdash;&mdash;'s."</p>

<p>However, all
these things are
by way of amusement.
I have
never come
across any deliberate
case of photographic
faking
with intent to
mislead or bear
false witness; but,
as I have already
stated, what may
be done for recreation
is also possible of application in more
serious affairs, and therefore it is a fallacy to
suppose that a photograph cannot lie.</p>

<p>Very little has been done, comparatively
speaking, in the direction of photograph
faking. It is an amusement I can recommend
to every devotee of the art; for
there are few pastimes more completely
fascinating.</p>

A STORY OF THE INDIAN MUTINY.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By J. F. Cornish.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Illustrated by Vereker M. Hamilton, R.P.E.</i></p>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Dinner</span> was preparing in the camp
under the toon-trees which covered
the foot-hills of the Himalayas.</p>

<p>Here, where the northern edge of the
Terai was beginning to become more alpine
in its character, the camp was pitched on
the fringe of the jungle. Below were
magnificent forests of sal, sisoon, and
toon-trees; above, pine, spruce, and oak
trees proclaimed a more tempered climate.</p>

<p>The spot had been chosen as healthy,
well supplied with water, and because
the best shooting in the district was fairly
accessible from it.</p>

<p>As the Colonel sat in his tent, he saw
emerging from the belt of jungle below an
extraordinary figure. He called to the
Captain and Subaltern, and they watched
it as it advanced towards them. The
shikaris and native bearers also paused in
their various duties, and jabbered among
themselves, intent on the approach of the
solitary man.</p>

<p>"No Nepaulese, that," asserted the
Captain.</p>

<p>"It's a white man," said the Subaltern.</p>

<p>"Wait," said the Colonel.</p>

<p>The figure drew nearer, and at last
came into full view. Clad in native dress,
weatherbeaten, brown, and lean, with a
snow-white beard that swept to his girdle,
looking as like a native as a native could
look, there was a certain indefinable <em>something</em>
about him which told these Englishmen
that a compatriot stood before them.
Yet, when the Colonel greeted him and
bade him welcome to the camp, he stared
vacantly and absently at him and made
no reply, but squatted gravely on the
ground.</p>

<p>The Subaltern quietly mixed a stiff peg
and handed it to the stranger, who shook
his head; but the Subaltern persisted, and
at length he took the glass, looked at it
gravely a moment, and then put it to
his lips&mdash;paused, and then, drinking the
whole at a draught, gravely held out the
glass to the Subaltern. As he did so, the
sleeve of his dress shortened, and his wrist
and part of his forearm were bared. The
Colonel went to the man, seized the slowly
retreating arm, and, pushing the sleeve
farther back, showed the others a device
tattooed thereon in red and blue. It was
two roses intertwined, and underneath the
motto, "<i lang="la">Aucto splendore resurgo</i>."</p>

<p>In great agitation the Colonel said,
"What's your name, sir?"</p>

<p>The newcomer shook his head. But
the Colonel, overcoming a passive resistance,
dragged him to his feet, looked again
at the device, and then closely scanned the
face, on a level with his own. He turned
pale under his bronze, dropped the hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
he held, and turning to the two others,
devoured with curiosity, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's Gascoyne, of the 53rd!"</p>

<p>Then the man, speaking for the first
time, said quietly, "Yes, I am Gascoyne,"
and, so speaking, collapsed on the grass at
the Colonel's feet. They took him up
and carried him into the largest tent, and
after some time, following on the ministrations
of the Subaltern, who had been
initiated into Red Cross ways, he opened
his eyes with a weary sigh, but the dull
light in them changed to one of bright
recognition, and looking at the Colonel he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ewan Campbell?"</p>

<p>"That's right, old fellow," said the
Colonel, "God bless you, that's right,
and you&mdash;you're Philip Gascoyne of the
53rd; but don't speak; drink this and
then go to sleep, and we'll talk in the
morning."</p>

<p>And, like an obedient child, the wanderer
did as he was bid, and the drink had been
so cunningly medicated by the Subaltern
that he slept all that night and through
many hours of the next day, the camp
being commanded to absolute silence by
the Colonel, who meanwhile explained to
his wondering companions that this man
who had quietly wandered into their midst
had, as all thought, perished in the Massacre
at Cawnpore.</p>

<p>"But," added the Colonel, "if he wakes
in his senses, we shall doubtless hear something
strange. He and I were pretty close
friends, and he was engaged to one of the
sweetest girls.... She was butchered
by the order of Nana Sahib."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus-0041.jpg" width="530" height="370" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HE SHOWED A DEVICE TATTOOED ON THE ARM IN RED AND BLUE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>At that moment the servant who had
been left in charge of the recovered Gascoyne
came up and told them that the
Sahib was awake and was asking to see
the Colonel. In a moment the three men
stood by the side of the wanderer's bed.</p>

<p>"How are you now, Gascoyne?" said
the Colonel. "Had a good sleep?"</p>

<p>Gascoyne's eyes turned inquiringly to
the other two.</p>

<p>"We're shooting up here, you know,"
replied the Colonel to his look. "This is
Cameron," indicating the Captain, "and
Dogan of the 74th&mdash;so you're among
friends, old fellow."</p>

<p>He smiled, and said quietly, "It is many
years since I heard the voice of a friend,"
and held out his hand, which the Colonel
took and pressed.</p>

<p>"I feel very feeble," he resumed.</p>

<p>"We'll doctor you up all right. Dogan
knows all the rigs of the medicine man."</p>

<p>Gascoyne protested with a feeble shake
of the head.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, "my mission's ended&mdash;but
thank God I've met you fellows
before going out." He paused, and then
went on again, "I have something to tell
you; but first tell me, was any attempt
made to find the devil who&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know whom you mean," said the
Colonel, "Nana Sahib, the man who gave
orders for the massacre at Cawnpore. Yes,
every effort was made, and a very large
reward was offered, but I am sorry to say
he was never captured, and his fate remains
a mystery to this day."</p>

<p>"I can clear that
mystery for you," said
the sick man, smiling
grimly; and then with
many pauses he told
his three wondering
listeners the tale I
here set down as the
Captain told it me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"England need not
waste another wish
for vengeance," Gascoyne
said, "I have
taken it. Listen. I
was amongst those
who, wearied out with
famine, fatigue, and
wounds, trusted to
Nana's oath, and embarked
on the boats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
only to be treacherously fired on and brought
back, such of us as survived, to face death,
with no chance of showing fight, and after
our suffering to die, shot down like dogs. I
had been wounded in the neck, and, though
the wound was slight, it bled profusely and
I was covered with the crimson stain.
You, Campbell, knew Miss Lindsay?" His
voice broke, and the Colonel nodded with
bright eyes, but in silence. "She had
been among the unhappy ladies brought
back, and all my fears and agony of mind
on her account utterly outbalanced any
consideration for myself.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus-0042.jpg" width="530" height="418" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"NERVED WITH HATE AND PASSION, I STRUCK HIM UNDER THE EAR."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Had all gone well, in a few short weeks
we should have been married, but she was
basely murdered in my very arms.</p>

<p>"After the fusillade which killed a number
of people, our boat was the first to be
brought back. As Miss Lindsay was stepping
over the side she slipped and fell into
the water. I sprang after to help her, when
a ruffianly Sepoy seized her by the hair,
which had become unfastened, and dragged
her to her feet, and with a brutal laugh
kissed her on the cheek. The laugh died
on his lips, for, maddened by all that had
occurred, and by this last outrage, I sprang
upon him, and, nerved with hate and passion,
struck him with all my force under
the ear.</p>

<p>"He fell as if shot, face downward into
the shallow water, and lay there dead.
Miss Lindsay turned, threw her arms
around me, and with a sob buried her
face on my shoulder. But though I had
avenged her momentarily, my triumph
was short, for a fellow named Survur Khan,
whose brother it was that I had killed,
with a cry of rage struck Miss Lindsay
on the head with a club he carried,
smashing her skull and covering me with
her blood and brains. It was horrible,
horrible, and with the horror of it I must
have lost consciousness, for I remember no
more until I found myself seated on the
ground with others. You know what happened.
By Nana's orders, after a momentary
respite, we were shot by the cowardly
miscreants, who would have fled in terror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
from us, had we been unbound with
weapons in our hands. But during that
moment's pause I had been thinking, thinking,
my heart seemed bursting in my body,
my brain throbbed and reeled, my whole
being was inflamed with the rage of anger
and hatred that consumed me. Oh! if I
were but free for a few moments to wreak
a vengeance on these cowardly hounds, and
die killing, killing.</p>

<p>"I resolved, if I could, to save my life,
even at this moment, to live for <em>vengeance</em>.
I watched every movement of our destroyers.
I knew every dialect of the Indian
language, and listened to every syllable they
said. You know the story how, there and
in cold blood, close to the well they shot us.
At the instant the word of command was
given, while the finger pressed the trigger,
I sprang round and fell on my face unhurt.
I feebly beat the ground with my feet, and
then lay still.</p>

<p>"I heard groans, a few more shots, and
then stillness. They came to me; one
fellow turned me over and felt in my
pockets. I had nothing; they tore open
my shirt and took from my neck a light
gold chain, with a locket containing Miss
Lindsay's miniature. I would have given
worlds to have jumped up, snatched the
locket from him, and served him as I had
served the butcher's brother; but I wanted
a wider vengeance, and I restrained myself.
To them I was dead. The fellow who had
taken the locket kicked me disdainfully,
and made a scurrilous remark about the
Mem Sahib whose face he saw in it; but,
even under that provocation, I was able to
control myself.</p>

<p>"I knew, I felt, I should be able to take
vengeance; how, I did not try to think,
but I was certain of it; and I lay calm&mdash;calm
as one who knows that nothing
will stand between him and the desire of
his heart. At length they went away and
left us as we lay.</p>

<p>"That night, when all was still, and I only
heard the howlings of the jackals without
the walls, I began to think it time to make
a move. I had lain for hours in the terrible
sun&mdash;my limbs were racked by an agonising
cramp, a maddening thirst parched my
throat and vitals, my lips and tongue were
baked and cracked, and my first movement
gave me pain unspeakable; then as I moved
again I heard a stealthy step, and a voice
said very softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Is any Sahib or Mem Sahib alive?'</p>

<p>"I lay still. I knew the infernal treachery
of these demons only too well, and gave no
sign. In another moment I felt a hand on
my breast. I controlled myself, I held my
breath, but I could not still the beating of
my heart. A voice whispered, as if of a
person talking to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"'This poor Sahib lives.'</p>

<p>"Then my head was raised, and in spite
of my clenched teeth a few drops of some
stimulant was forced into my mouth&mdash;which,
cracked and parched, tasted nothing&mdash;I
only felt the burning sensation of some
powerful spirit.</p>

<p>"'Drink, sir,' said the voice; 'I am your
friend; it will restore your strength.'</p>

<p>"I ventured to open my eyes. I saw
bending over me a venerable form, and the
face of a Brahmin I had seen before.</p>

<p>"'Do not fear, sir; I am Nanukchund; I
have no part with these murderous men.
But let us not talk; I will take you and hide
you if it is possible that you can walk,
but we must not be seen.'</p>

<p>"The thought of the possibility of living
for the vengeance which had kept me alive
through the horrors of that day nerved me
afresh; the cramping pains that shot agony
through my frame were forgotten; I almost
stood upright, but Nanukchund pulled me
down.</p>

<p>"'In the name of Budda, caution,' he
whispered; 'there may be some who look;
if I am seen it will be thought (and he
shuddered) that I plunder the dead; but if
you, then death will come for both. See, I
go to the shadow of yonder house; lie still
for a moment, and then crawl like the snake
until you reach it; but first drink.'</p>

<p>"I drank, and the fire ran through my
veins, and renewed my strength. He,
looking to the right and to the left and
crouching, soon gained the shadow he had
indicated. After the lapse of what seemed
an age, I began to crawl thither too, with
pain and difficulty indescribable. At length
I stood beside my rescuer.</p>

<p>"'Not yet are you safe,' said he, and
from underneath his garments he produced
a bundle. 'Put on this.' I unfolded it,
and found a garment similar to his own,
with cloth for a turban.</p>

<p>"In a few moments I had become a
native. The bronze of my face, with
added dust and blood, made my complexion
dark as his own. In a few words
I told him I was Captain Gascoyne of
the 53rd.</p>

<p>"'Then,' said he, quickly, 'you can speak
as one of us, and none can know any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
difference.' From that moment, except
on three occasions, I have spoken no
English until now.</p>

<p>"Proceeding with infinite caution, once or
twice scanned by straggling mutineers, all
of whom were more or less under the influence
of bhang, we at length reached his
house, a secluded one by the river. There
for some days I lay in a stupor of sleep,
yet with the one idea of vengeance running
like a dark thread
through my slumbers,
in which I saw again
my poor girl's fair hair
clotted with blood, and
felt it clinging round
my neck and face.</p>

<p>"When my weary
limbs and brain were
rested, I was able to
talk to Nanukchund,
my preserver. He told
me much that of course
you know&mdash;of the outbreak,
of the excesses
of the mutineers, which
he deplored, for he
knew how the reckoning
would be, and that
he was the friend of the
Sahibs, and after we
had been shot down,
came to see if life remained
in any of us.</p>

<p>"He was a far-sighted
man, and he
knew that the yoke
these fiends were trying
to throw off would
be only the more
strongly riveted round
their necks, and he
knew that the English
raj was more wise,
more just and merciful,
than the divided tyrannies
of their own
Princes. One day he
came to the room where I lay, and, with tears
running down his face, told me with terror,
lest I should rise up and slay him because
of his kinship with such demons, of the
massacre of the women and children by the
order of the bastard Raja of Bithoor, Nana
Sahib&mdash;how the Sepoys, commanded to
shoot them, thrust their guns through the
windows, and fired a volley over their heads,
and then, sickened of the horror, refused to
have anything more to do with it; and no
one at first could be found to carry out the
brute's orders, until at last Survur Khan, the
butcher&mdash;the same who had killed my little
Madge&mdash;volunteered for the murderous job.
Then another monster was found, and with
swords they went into the slaughter pen,
Survur coming out to replace one sword he
had broken, by another."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 431px;">

<div class="caption"><p>"THE COLONEL CRIED OUT, 'FOR GOD'S SAKE, STOP.'"</p></div>
</div>

<p>At this point of Gascoyne's narrative, so
the Captain told me, the Colonel cried out,
"For God's sake, stop," and got up and
went out of the tent, and Gascoyne said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember; he lost a wife and a
little girl there."</p>

<p>And then the Captain and the Subaltern
understood the Colonel's silence generally,
and his fierce anger when he did speak of
those days.</p>

<p>It was the next day before Gascoyne
resumed his story.</p>

<p>"After Nanukchund's story," he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
on, "a dull feeling of hatred, mingled with
my purpose of vengeance, took possession
of me; and though I loathed the sight of a
black face, I found myself under the necessity
of assuming one myself. With great
care I stained myself all over, and at length
both Nanukchund and I were satisfied that
my disguise was perfect.</p>

<p>"Some of our men had spent months
among the natives undetected; and my
own perfect knowledge of the languages
spoken in the Gangetic districts, and of the
habits and customs of the people, rendered
me secure. To Nanukchund I said nothing
of my project. So far as he knew, I was
only going to join my countrymen where-ever
I could find them in force. I said
good-bye to him, and promised, when
things were settled, he should be gratefully
remembered, and I gave him a letter
that should have insured his safety in case
our people laid hands on him. The next
day I was one amongst the ruffians who
had butchered my comrades and my
countrywomen. That very night I had a
chance of killing Survur Khan the butcher.
I found him drunk in the doorway of a
deserted house. No one was near. I
dragged him inside. He laid like a log on
the floor. I stood over him, and was about
to plunge my knife into his heart, but I
reflected.</p>

<p>"He would die insensible to his end; he
would not know why he died. So I altered
my mind, and on his forehead I made two
deep incisions in the form of a cross. The
brute moved and groaned, but he was too
far under the influence of bhang to be conscious.
When I next saw him, although
the wound was covered by his turban, I
knew by the look in his eyes there was a
terror in his heart, which would remain
with him until his hour came. The next
day Nana retreated on Bithoor, accompanied
by the Begum. Then after Futtehpore
he retreated with about 3,000 followers
into Nepaul, whither I accompanied him."</p>

<p>"From this," said the Colonel, "nothing
certain of him was known."</p>

<p>"You shall hear now," said Gascoyne,
and continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"From the first, dissensions and quarrels
arose, which, with desertions, soon reduced
their followers to half their number. With
the remainder, for nearly two years Nana
lived like an outlaw, moving from
place to place, his followers slowly diminishing
in numbers, from desertion and
deaths, disease and hunger, for provisions
were terribly scarce and dear. Nana and
the Begum were both carried, whenever a
move was made, in dhoolies, but now it began
to be difficult to find bearers; and here
my great opportunity opened for me.</p>

<p>"With the money supplied to me by
Nanukchund I paid certain of the ablest-bodied
bearers to become my servants.
These I humbly placed at the Rajah's
disposal. With gratitude he accepted my
offer, for he looked with the anticipation of
terror toward the time when he might be
compelled to walk, for his obesity was now
so great, as also was the Begum's, and his
Oriental hatred of exertion was so pronounced,
that death would almost be preferable.
I kept my bearers fed and ready
at his will, and I became his favoured slave,
but I laughed in my heart, for I was preparing
his sacrifice.</p>

<p>"After another year of wandering, the
word spread of a great reward offered by the
English Government for the Nana, dead or
alive, also of pardon for all not actually
guilty of murder. Then a conspiracy
among the hundred or so followers left
was set on foot to earn the reward, but,
still determined to feed my unsatisfied vengeance,
I betrayed it to the Rajah, and,
heading those who were still faithful to him,
I fell on the conspirators the night before
their projected outbreak, and slaughtered
them to a man; and no word can paint the
fierce joy I felt as my sword found its sheath
in the hearts of the murderous villains. Our
numbers now scarcely reached 50, amongst
whom was Survur Khan. This man's life
had now become a terror to him. I haunted
his sleeping and his waking hours. I
always made him feel that Nemesis hovered
near. He had long ago found that I knew
of the scar on his forehead.</p>

<p>"'How comes it, brother,' I had asked
him, 'that you have the sign of the Christian
on your forehead?'</p>

<p>"At first he eyed me askance, and was
surly; then, after, he told me how, waking
from his orgie, he had found himself thus
marked. I said, 'Then surely some accursed
Feringhee has marked you, that he may
know you again one day.'</p>

<p>"'Nay,' he answered, 'that cannot be,
for none were left alive in Cawnpore at the
time.'</p>

<p>"'No, nor any women or children, as you
know. See!' I cried, thrusting back his
turban, 'See! thy scar is white and livid!
It is some god of the Feringhees who has
marked thee for his vengeance.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thereafter his life was hell. And so we
wandered again&mdash;how long I cannot tell&mdash;months,
years&mdash;I don't know&mdash;until at last
there were left, besides the Nana and the
Begum, only three or four more who performed
menial offices, and myself. Then
a tiger killed two of these, and the other
two ran away.</p>

<p>"For me, I had become lean and burnt
to almost Indian blackness. They did
not suspect me. I had carefully kept my
weapons in order, and I was now master
of the situation.</p>

<p>"One night, after the last two men had
gone, Nana, whose inability to walk had
become a real
terror, told us we
must remain in
the clearing by
the river bank
where we were,
and there live.</p>

<p>"That night,
while they slept,
I waked, and
without awakening
them I bound
them all, so that
when they woke
they would be
unable to move
more than a hand.
Then I went to
the river and
cleansed myself
as thoroughly as
I could, and, secure
in my preparations,
lay
down and slept
soundly. Shortly
after, I heard
Nana's voice calling
me. I rose,
and my eye fell on Survur Khan. He knew
his hour had come; he was livid with fear;
he did not know who had bound him&mdash;he
only knew he was unable to move. He
saw me&mdash;he saw the expression in my eyes&mdash;it
was enough. Then I passed to where
the Nana and Begum lay. He demanded
what this meant.</p>

<p>"'Get up,' I said, 'and you shall
know.'</p>

<p>"Shaking with fear, the Begum stood
upright. I led them to the opening. When
they saw Survur Khan they turned ashen
grey.</p>

<p>"'See,' I cried in English, 'you three,
I am an English officer. All this time
I have followed you, helped you, fed you,
shielded you in danger, that I might avenge
on you the murder of the woman I loved,
and of my countrywomen, with my own
hand. Look,' I cried, tearing off Survur
Khan's head covering, 'ask him where he
got that scar. He does not know, but I
can tell you. I found him drunk and could
have killed him, but I put my mark on
him instead. Directly, you shall see what
I have saved him for. I was one of those
whom you shot down after you took us
from the boats, but I feigned death and
escaped.'</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"'LOOK,' I CRIED, TEARING OFF HIS HEAD COVERING, 'ASK HIM WHERE
HE GOT THAT SCAR.'"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The fear of death was on them all. The
Begum and Nana grovelled at my feet;
they offered me countless gems, they would
tell me where they were hidden, if I would
but let them live&mdash;only spare their lives.
I could not mean to kill them in cold blood&mdash;I
was an Englishman.</p>

<p>"I let them go on until they had exhausted
themselves with cries and tears and
entreaties, and then I said, 'I do not mean to
kill you yet, but that you may feel certain of
your end, see this man die. He dashed out
the brains of my lover while she lay in
my arms. The death he gave her is now
meted out to himself.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Survur Khan was now a shaking jelly
of fear. I went to him, and, with a mace I
had always carried, struck him full and fair
on the scar. So perished the butcher of
our sisters.</p>

<p>"Then commenced
the
penance of the
other two. To
walk a hundred
yards was
pain and misery
to them,
but for two
hours I made
them walk;
when they
would have
stayed, a prick
from the point
of my knife
urged them on,
and groaning
and stumbling
they went forward.</p>

<p>"That evening
when I
drove them
back to the
little clearing
they knew
what hunger,
thirst, and fatigue
were.
Their clothes
were already
in rags, their
feet bleeding
and sore.</p>

<p>"The corpse
of Survur
Khan lay
there. The
crows had been
busy on it.</p>

<p>"'Look,' I
cried; 'as his
fate was, so
shall yours be.'</p>

<p>"They groaned, and falling on the ground
lay there stunned with the horror of their
situation.</p>

<p>"'Henceforth you are my slaves,' I continued.
'Get up and throw that fellow
into the river.' They hesitated, but the
point of the knife persuaded them, and
they in shuddering disgust did as I commanded.</p>

<p>THE MONUMENT OVER THE CAWNPORE WELL.</p>

<p>(This was the well into which the bodies of the massacred women and
children were thrown.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Then I fed them sparingly with rice and
water, and the next day they recommenced
their pilgrimage. In spite of their cries
and groans I drove them like cattle.</p>

<p>"Day after
day, month
after month, I
drove them until
they were
reduced to the
shadows of
what they
were, and then
I began to
think it time
they died. I
was aweary of
my own vengeance.</p>

<p>"Long before,
I had
found a young
panther cub.
As it grew it
evinced a
strange love
for me. No
dog that ever
attached itself
to a man could
have been more
absolutely devoted
to him
than the panther
to me. In
proportion as it
loved me, so it
hated my victims.
In all
our trampings
it followed at
my heels. At
night I had to
fasten it up, or
it would have
forestalled me.</p>

<p>"Now I began
to brood
what should
be their end.</p>

<p>"I hesitated, and for a time almost wavered.
After all, the Begum was a woman,
and I could not kill a woman, though both
she and the other had entreated me to do
so a hundred times, for the fatigue and
hunger and sleeplessness I subjected them
to had made such a horror of their lives,
that, curs as they were, death seemed
preferable. Moreover I never ceased to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
remind them of their hellish deeds, and I
embittered their every hour by recalling to
them how I had waited for those hours,
and of their certain deaths.</p>

<p>"While I hesitated, his master the devil
put it into the Nana's head to help me.
He saw and divined my hesitation.</p>

<p>"One day he stood before me, gaunt and
starving.</p>

<p>"'You cannot kill her,' he said.</p>

<p>"'No,' I replied, 'she is a woman.'</p>

<p>"A hideous sneer made his gaunt jaws
horrible.</p>

<p>"'I will kill her if you will let me go.'</p>

<p>"There he was, devil to the last. He
trembled with the eagerness of anticipated
freedom.</p>

<p>"'Go,' I said. He hesitated, but my
look was firm, and he went.</p>

<p>"Once or twice since their fat was gone
they had attempted to escape, but the last
time I lashed the man unmercifully, and
said if they tried to escape again I would
let the panther deal with them. That
cowed them thoroughly, and thenceforward
they hung on every glance of my eye.</p>

<p>"But their enforced marchings were no
longer such a terror as they had been, and
I determined to make an end. But while
I thought of it he came before me again.</p>

<p>"'Master,' he said, 'let me kill her; give
me my life for hers.'</p>

<p>"I did not reply, neither did my glance
forbid him. I could only think of Margaret,
with the blood on her fair hair. I turned
from him without a word.</p>

<p>"'Master,' he said again, 'will you set
me free if I do?'</p>

<p>"He turned and left me. I sat on the
river bank and waited. In half an hour he
returned and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Master, come and see.' And I followed
him to a small open space in the jungle.
What had been the Begum, lay there cold
and still. The
arch-villain
had strangled
her.</p>

<p>"I made a
sign to the
panther. With
a bound he
was on him;
and the head
that had conceived
the
horrors of
Cawnpore
cracked between
the panther's teeth. My vengeance
was complete.</p>

<p>"After that, it seems, I must have wandered
for years, until you found me. I remember
nothing, except that the panther
was always with me."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When he had finished his story he lay
back and closed his eyes, and then sank
into a stupor. From this all the Subaltern's
medicinal arts could not rouse him.</p>

<p>The next day at dawn he cried out, and
they all ran to him.</p>

<p>"Carry me to the jungle edge," he said,
"the end has come."</p>

<p>They carried him, and laid him on a
mattress, for he could not stand.</p>

<p>Then he raised his voice in a shrill and
piercing cry, that echoed through the jungle.</p>

<p>A dead silence followed.</p>

<p>Then again, as if in an expiring effort,
he raised another cry, louder and shriller,
and more prolonged than the other.</p>

<p>Then, far off in the gloomy depths of the
jungle, a dull muffled roar responded.</p>

<p>They waited, and once again Gascoyne
sent up the cry.</p>

<p>Then the leaves of the jungle parted, and
a panther, black and mangy, but with the
fierce light still alive in the topaz eyes,
bounded to the side of the recumbent figure,
and began to lick its face, snarling at the
three men.</p>

<p>Gascoyne lifted his hand, and the great
beast crouched beside him. And so the
group remained while a man might have
counted twenty. Then Gascoyne raised himself,
and stretched out his arms, as if to
someone at the foot of his couch, "Madge,
Madge," he cried hoarsely, "I am coming,"
and so fell back and moved no more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They buried him that evening with the
panther, which they had been compelled to
shoot.</p>

<p>It was very
old, its teeth
and claws
were worn to
stumps; and
how they had
lived together,
and whether
the beast
had hunted for
the man, or
the man for the
beast, none
ever knew.</p>

SOME ADVENTURES IN SCALING ITS WALLS.</h2>

<div class="caption"><p>SHOWING HOW THE FORTRESS IS
ASCENDED AND THE GROOVES
WHERE THE GALLERY RAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> the most remarkable
rock in the world is to be
found in the centre of the
Island of Ceylon, and its
story is full of romance
It was fortified 1,400
years ago to shelter a
cowardly parricide, and
when he died it became
a Buddhist
monastery. But for
centuries no human
foot rested on its
summit; it was
the abode of
silence; its
walls were
buried beneath
the
dust of
ages,
birds
built
their
nests
on it
and
the beasts of the field
haunted the jungle which
grew about its base.</p>

<p>Now British officials
have scaled its walls, excavated
its ruins, and revealed
the ancient splendour of the
place, and so doing have discovered
that this rock fortress is
one of the most wonderful pieces
of engineering of ancient times.</p>

<p>It is called the Sigiri or Lion Rock,
and lies fourteen miles north-east of
Dambutta. It is cylindrical in shape,
and rises up nearly 600 feet sheer from the
ground, while the area of the summit is
little over an acre. Its scarped walls are
nearly perpendicular, and in some places they
overhang their base.</p>

<p>Recent excavation shows that all round the
foot of the rock there was a fortified city, surrounded
by a moat. But the most wonderful feature
of this fortress was the terrace, ornamented
with lions, which ran round the north face of the
rock at its smallest diameter. At one part it stood
upon the rock which projected below, and at the same
time was protected by that part which overhung it. The
terrace then zig-zagged up the rock at an easy gradient, and
so gave access to its otherwise inaccessible summit, to
which, in the last resort, the fugitive intended to flee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>One hundred yards of this terrace still
remains, and its structure of several courses
of brick can clearly be seen in one of the
photographs, while the grooves in the
rock show where the rest of it ran. Professor
Davids says that the path was on
the top of a solid brick wall, four or five
feet broad, which was carried along the
face of the cliff. "The cliff being perpendicular,
this wall had to descend far
below the path before it found a resting-place
on the edge of the rock. As the
path was gradually carried forward and
upward, a line was dropped from it to
the rock beneath, and where the line first
touched the cliff&mdash;however far below&mdash;a
flat place was scooped out, large enough
to support a single brick. This was done
along the whole breadth of the path, and
then the solid wall was built up to the
requisite height, while some of the outer
rows of bricks were carried high enough to
form a wall breast high on the outer side."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus-0050.jpg" width="530" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE SIGIRI ROCK FORTRESS AS IT STANDS TO-DAY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Half way up the rock, or 160 feet from the
ground, was another extraordinary feature.
There can be seen, by means of a telescope,
in two caves or pockets some vividly painted
frescoes. How they were painted in such
a position no one knows; but, despite their
clearness of outline and freshness of colour,
it is certain that they were painted by
artists 1,400 years ago.</p>

<p>But though we do not know how these
frescoes were painted so long ago, thrilling
stories can be told of how two artists made
copies of them not long since.</p>

<p>Mr. Alick Murray, of the Ceylon Civil
Service, was requested by the Governor of
the Island to make an attempt to reach
these frescoes, and he succeeded in an
amazing manner. The first part of the
way lay through the forest, which was
cleared with billhooks by the natives. At
the outset the resident chiefs and local
population would have nothing to do with
the disturbance of a rock chamber which
they believed to be inhabited and protected
by demons, so Tamils had to be brought
from India.</p>

<p>Three Tamil stone-cutters bored holes
in the rock face, one above the other, and
therein placed iron "jumpers," which were
secured with cement. To these wooden
staging was lashed. "The man of lightest
weight," says Mr. Murray, "was selected
to make the necessary holes, but after
a while even he declared that it
was impossible for him to ascend
any higher. But he said that if he
were allowed to devote three days
to fasting and prayer to his gods,
he thought he might succeed, and
so he did.</p>

<p>"But when the pocket was at last
reached it was found that the floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
was at too steep an angle to admit of anyone
standing or even sitting on it. Iron stanchions
were therefore let into the floor, and a
strong trestle or framework made secure to
them. On this framework was placed a platform,
and from the platform the work of
tracing thirteen of the frescoes in the biggest
cave was carried out."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 203px;">
<img src="images/illus-0051.jpg" width="203" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>PART OF THE WONDERFUL GALLERY WHICH LED TO
THE TOP OF THE FORTRESS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Murray's task was surely unique.
From sunrise to sunset for a week he did
his copying lying on his back.</p>

<p>"Below me," he says, "was a sheer
drop of 160 feet. The wind at times was
terrific, and I literally held my breath
as some blast swept into and around the
chamber, and ruthlessly tore and
carried off the work of hours.
On one occasion a blast fiercer
than the rest shook the platform
to its very base, and the lashings,
slackened by the dryness of the
atmosphere, allowed the platform
to sink suddenly a few
inches, when its downward progress
was happily arrested by
the bracing underneath. The
only inmates of the chamber were
swallows, who occasionally
pecked at me resentfully."</p>

<p>The frescoes are life-size figures
of women, arranged singly or in
sets of two. Each couple represents
a mistress and maid, the maid
wearing in each case a jacket
exactly similar to that used by
Tamil girls to-day.</p>

<p>When Mr. Murray had finished
his work it was suggested that it
would be a good thing to leave
something in the "pocket," in the
shape of a memento. A bottle was
therefore obtained, and in it papers
of the day and local coins were
placed. As he was leaving with
his companions a Buddhist priest
asked to be allowed to pray for the
preservation of the bottle, and while
he prayed Mr. Murray and his
companions sang "God save the
Queen," by way of dedication&mdash;a
characteristically British proceeding.</p>

<p>Mr. Murray's tracings caused so
much interest in the wonderful
Rock Fortress, that the Government
of Ceylon instructed its
Archæological Commissioner, Mr.
H. C. P. Bell, to survey and
excavate it&mdash;a work of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
adventure. Hair-breadth escapes inevitably
occurred, and all the time the work
was in hand Mr. Bell declares that he was
on mental "tenter-hooks."</p>

<p>He first reached the top of the rock by
means of jungle wood ladders (such as
those shown in the photos) and six-inch
grooves cut in the rock. But once up, iron
ladders and an iron rail were fixed so that
constant ascent and descent could be made.</p>

<p>During the first fortnight the workers
were attacked by swarms of bees, which
drove them from the rock. These had to
be burned out before the work could proceed.
But the greatest trial was the
dreadful heat of the sun, from which there
was no shelter. The work began at 6.30 in
the morning and continued till 3 o'clock,
and 8½ hours in the scorching sun, day
after day, and week after week, was no
light task. The whole day was spent aloft,
for too much time would have been wasted
if "lunch" had been "served" below.
Fortunately a big cistern was discovered at
the top, from which beautiful water could
be obtained.</p>

<p>When the first prejudice had died away,
plenty of workers could be found, and
sometimes over a hundred of them were
at work and swarmed up the rock with as
little excitement as English workmen pass
through their factory door.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus-0052.jpg" width="530" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>SUMMIT OF FORTRESS AS RECENTLY EXCAVATED.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The top was found to be covered with
forest trees and a dense undergrowth, neck
high, so a gang of Singhalese were engaged
to burn them down. When the summit
was excavated it was found that buildings
covered it to the very edge of the cliff, and
every basketful of earth had therefore to
be spilt over the side of the rock&mdash;otherwise
it would have to be moved twice over.
The depth of earth cutting varied from five
to twenty feet, and when the whole area
was cleared the plan of the long lost buildings
was easily seen, virtually as perfect as
when first laid out. The natives declared
that there was a passage from the summit
into the bowels of the rock, but that is
not the case.</p>

<p>"The rooms and courtyards," says
Mr. Bell, "stretch the whole length of the
ridge, in generally ascending tiers, from
the small chamber directly above the rock
cistern at the south to the penultimate
and uppermost room near the north end.
All are oblong, and all&mdash;or nearly all&mdash;the
chambers had corridors completely round
them.</p>

<p>"Many passages were paved throughout
with quartz slabs; though much of this
choice pavement has been displaced by
the waste of centuries, or from being deliberately
put to other uses by Buddhist
monks when the fortune of war found them
located in the 'marble halls' of royalty."</p>

<p>Even around the summit of this inaccessible
rock a
remarkable wall
was built. It
rose from the
brink of the
precipice, for its
foundations were
some feet and
even yards below
the level of the
summit.</p>

<p>Accompanying
Mr. Bell on this
expedition was
Mr. D. A. L.
Perera, whose
purpose was to
paint in oils facsimiles
of all the
frescoes in both
caves. Both were
anxious to photograph
the two
pockets at a distance,
and, as
they could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
stand in the air, a four-inch
hawser was lowered from the
summit of the rock to the
ground, and a strong iron block
bound to the end. Through
the block a new two-inch rope
was passed, and an improvised chair firmly
tied to it, and in this the photographer took
his seat. The hawser was then pulled halfway
up to the west rock till the chair was
over 150 feet from the ground and 50 feet
clear of the cliff. Swaying in mid-air through
the force of the wind, the photographer
exposed his negative, but as the shutter
worked too slowly the pictures taken were
more or less blurred.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY STUDIO IN THE WORLD&mdash;MR. PERERA AT WORK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Perera then decided to do an oil
painting of the pockets to scale while
swinging at the end of the rope, and after
rocking in space for a week succeeded in
his task. But the exposure day after day
to the intense glare of the rock's summit
affected his eyesight, and he was compelled
to take complete rest for some
weeks.</p>

<p>One of our photographs shows Mr.
Perera at work. Thirteen of the pictures
were painted from the floor of the
cave; to do the others "it was necessary
to construct a cantilever of jungle timber
firmly lashed to a stout iron cramp let
into
the
rock
floor. To
the extremity
of this projection
was tied a
rough 'cage' of
sticks; and from
this uncomfortable
and perilous perch
the loftiest fresco
was made." This
was painting "in
the open" with a
vengeance.</p>

<p>Enormous difficulty
was experienced
in painting
the frescoes in the
small cave (which
was only three
feet wide) and in
getting to that cave
from the other.
The ledge between
them was only a
cubit in width. But
by paying special
remuneration Mr.
Bell got some men
to risk their lives
in making a "stick shelf." One-inch
iron bars supported the woodwork, which
was banded strongly to thick iron cramped
into the rock. But in addition it was
held up by a central hawser, and side
ropes hauled taut round trees on the
summit of the rock nearly 300 feet up.
When finished this improvised platform
stood out from the cliff 15 feet horizontally!</p>

<p>In these wonderful, dangerous, and eerie
open-air studios, Mr. Perera spent nineteen
weary weeks painting on canvas a complete
set of the 22 frescoes which were
first painted 1,400 years ago. These are
marvellous in their faithfulness and colour.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Perera began to paint the frescoes,
iron standards 3 feet 4 inches in height,
with a single top rail, were driven along
the edge of both pockets and the connecting
ledge between them; for without such
handrail a slip on the smooth inclined floor
of the pocket would have meant instant
death on the rocks below.</p>

<p>Yet another adventure was the outcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
of this exciting survey, and Mr. Bell
vividly tells the tale. "High up on the
eastern face of the rock," he says, "may
be noticed a dark streak betokening caves,
and these we resolved to survey. But the
rock scarp below them being nowhere less
than 30 degrees in slope, and in places
sheer, ascent without the aid of a rope was
impossible. The four-inch hawser was therefore
let down to the ground as before over
the brow of the caves.</p>

<p>"Up this stout rope half a dozen of the
strongest and most sure-headed coolies
swarmed to the apparent mouth of the
caves. The measured distance was 294 feet,
climbed hand over hand the whole way up.
But arriving at this height they found that
they were 50 feet distant from the caves and
still below their floor, with no means of
getting nearer, owing to the projecting crag
above, and the rope's own weight keeping
it taut.</p>

<p>"Ultimately a brave Singhalese lad with
a light rope round his waist swung himself
on to the rock as high as he could, and
crawled crocodile fashion the rest of the
way up the steep smooth slope while the
men held the other end of the rope. Once
in the caves he noosed the rope to a piece
of fallen rock, and next day a strong iron
ring was driven into the floor, and a hawser
passed through it.</p>

<p>"Then Mr. Perera and I made the
ascent. The largest cavern was 197 feet
long, with a floor width averaging 11 feet.
No vegetation grows therein. But we did
find under a rock in the cave three eggs of
the peregrine falcon, which vary strangely
in hue from chocolate to almost white.
The eggs of this bird have never been
taken in Ceylon before.</p>

<p>"We were grievously disappointed
with our search, and had
to be content with a bare negative
gain&mdash;the absolute assurance that
the caves contained no trace of
previous human occupation. The
foot of man never desecrated this
sanctuary of the eagle and falcon
before. Being virtually inaccessible,
it was left to bird and bat and
mountain bee. Overhead the beetling
crag jutted out forty feet and
more, while under foot the rock floor
was polished and slippery from
untold centuries of wear by the feet
of myriads on myriads of birds."</p>

<p>If, however, in years to come an
adventurous climber climbs to this
chamber of the winds he will find in a
niche a sealed record of its daring exploration,
and in just such a way the buried
buildings on the Sigiri Rock are the
record of a crime of 1,400 years ago.</p>

<p>A king of Ceylon was buried alive with
his face to the east by his brutal son, who
became king in his place. This in its
turn was said to be a punishment because
the old king buried alive a holy man who
was in his way when building a great tank.</p>

<p>But, dreading the revenge of his brother,
the young king fortified the Sigiri rock.
There he lived for eighteen miserable years,
and at the end of that time his brother came
and slew him.</p>

<p>He happened to turn his elephant to
avoid a pit, and, thinking he was running
away, his people lost heart and the enemy
cried out, "They're running away."</p>

<p>Instead of hiding within his fortress,
when the critical moment came, the man
it was to protect had lost faith in it, and
in his misery went out to his last fight.</p>

<h2><a name="MY_FAIR_NEIGHBOURS_PIANO" id="MY_FAIR_NEIGHBOURS_PIANO">MY FAIR NEIGHBOUR'S PIANO,
AND WHAT CAME OF IT.</a></h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">When</span> I heard that a lady had taken
the flat over mine, I feared the worst.
The worst had come. Dum-dum-dum went
the throbbing piano above. The former
occupants of that flat has possessed a baby
which I used to anathematise, but even its
merry crowings or midnight howls were
better than this.</p>

<p>The lady&mdash;an elderly lady of the spinster
persuasion&mdash;had passed me several times
on the stairs, and I heartily wished that
Providence had blessed her with a husband
and several children to occupy her spare
time. If I ever wanted to go into Parliament,
I should have only one item in my
programme, and that would be to make a
licence as necessary for music in a private
as in a public house. There it went&mdash;dum-dum-dum&mdash;with
intervals in which
that detestable old maid picked up dropped
bars as though she were picking up
dropped stitches.</p>

<p>Three times I sat down to tackle the
Settled Land Acts, and three times I
angrily shut the book without having comprehended
a single section.</p>

<p>I was going in for my final at the end of
six weeks, and the result of the examination
would be of considerable importance
to me.</p>

<p>My uncle had paid for most of my education,
and held out prospects of a partnership,
but as time went on his beneficent
intentions had lost their keenness, and a
failure would produce considerably less
likelihood of those prospects becoming
actual facts. He was an old gentleman
who judged by results, and the creditable
results of my life had hitherto been few.
A decent place in the Honours List would
mean a probability, a prize would mean a
certainty, of a comfortable income for life;
and if I was to work, that infernal noise
must stop. Legal redress I had none, nor
would complaint to the landlord be of any
use. There were clauses in the leases
against keeping canaries, or even window-boxes,
but none forbidding pianos. There
was only one course open to me, and that
was to appeal to the better feelings of the
elderly spinster.</p>

<p>At first I thought of writing a note, and
made some attempts at composing one, but
they were either too violent or too unconvincing,
and I felt that in dealing with a person
of her description a personal interview
would produce better fruit. On considering
the matter, I decided that the interview had
better take place at once. It was an unconventional
hour to call, but I was not
certain that I should have the courage to
protest except in the heat of indignation,
and I had decided on an effective <em>rôle</em>. I
intended to appeal to her as a hard-working
young man whom she was depriving of a
livelihood, and to a certain extent to be
appealingly distressed.</p>

<p>Armed with these intentions, I mounted
the stairs, knocked at the door, and asked
for Miss Ormerod, which I had gathered was
the lady's name. The servant looked at me
a little doubtfully, but finally the piano
stopped, and she asked me to come in. I
put on my most pathetic expression, and
entered. I confronted a lady who had just
risen from the piano. With some surprise
I noticed that it was not the elderly spinster,
but a little damsel of prepossessing attributes,
and with big merry-hearted eyes.</p>

<p>"I came to see Miss Ormerod," I explained.</p>

<p>"I am Miss Ormerod," she answered.</p>

<p>I am never a very self-possessed young
man, and this sudden upsetting of my plans
took me aback. The elderly spinster was
obviously only a frequent visitor. It is
one thing to appeal pathetically to the
better feelings of a lady of advanced years,
and another to explain matters to a young
damsel.</p>

<p>"I live in the flat down below," I continued,
"and I came to call to&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Came to call?" she answered, with an
amused air, and a glance at the clock.</p>

<p>"Not to call in the ordinary way," I
stammered, "but I couldn't help it. You
see, you were playing the piano, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wasn't it sufficiently audible down
below?" she inquired, chillingly.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 496px;">
<img src="images/illus-0057.jpg" width="496" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I PUT ON MY MOST PATHETIC EXPRESSION, AND ENTERED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Quite audible," I answered, catching
eagerly at the chance of explanation. "In
fact it was too audible&mdash;that was just it.
It's rather disturbing in my flat."</p>

<p>"And may I ask why I am not to play
the piano?" she replied. "There was a
noise in your flat the night before last considerably
less melodious than a piano."</p>

<p>"I suppose there was. Ellis and some
other men came to a farewell dinner with
me before his departure to India. It
shan't occur again," I said; "and you
see, I'm reading for my final, and if you
could&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked at me somewhat doubtfully.</p>

<p>"The Solicitor's final," I added&mdash;it was
a fragment of my intended appeal to the
elderly spinster&mdash;"is a very difficult examination,
and requires concentrated attention."</p>

<p>"You're reading for the Solicitor's
final?" she exclaimed, with a sudden
change of expression. "Oh, then you must
know a lot of law."</p>

<p>"That scarcely follows," I began to
protest, in some surprise.</p>

<p>"And you can explain
to me what a negotiable
instrument really is," she
went on, delightedly.</p>

<p>I began to think she
must be mad.</p>

<p>"I've been trying to
make it out since tea
time," she said, "and I
can't. That's why I was
strumming."</p>

<p>"Has something gone
wrong with a cheque?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she laughed,
"you don't understand.
I'm reading law too. I'm
going in for an exam at
the London University.
You won't mind explaining
about negotiable instruments,
will you, if I
promise not to play the
piano? Please sit down."</p>

<p>I sat down and explained
the matter as
lucidly as I could. The
explanation took some
little time, but though
it was nearly eleven when
I left, the proceeding
seemed to strike her as
perfectly natural, and I
did not complain, particularly as it meant
deliverance from the piano.</p>

<p>The next night, however, I had scarcely
settled down when the strumming began
once more. After the trouble that I had
taken the night before it was ungrateful
of the damsel, and she had distinctly promised
that the noise should not occur
again. I stood it for half an hour, and
then went up to make another protest.</p>

<p>"I thought you were never coming,"
the damsel said, in an aggrieved way; "I
want you to tell me the difference between
a cheque and a bill of exchange payable
at a banker's. Have some tea, won't you?"</p>

<p>I had some tea, and furnished her with
further information. We discussed the
Bills of Exchange Act at some length. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
was a much pleasanter way of imbibing
the law than by one's self, and her <i lang="la">vivâ
voce</i> examination was not without its uses.
However, the situation was unconventional,
and I had my doubts on its advisability.</p>

<p>The next afternoon, when I came back
from the office, I was informed that a lady
was waiting to see me. In my room, sitting
perpendicularly on the edge of an
armchair, was the elderly spinster.</p>

<p>"Is your name Arbuthnot?" she inquired,
abruptly and severely.</p>

<p>I admitted the accusation.</p>

<p>"Then, Mr. Arbuthnot," she said, grimly,
"I wish to have a word with you. I hear you
have been forcing yourself on my niece."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?" I said, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Forcing yourself on that poor misguided
child," she continued, "and taking advantage
of her folly in the most ungentlemanly way."</p>

<p>"If you mean Miss Ormerod," I answered,
"perhaps I might explain."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you might," she replied, acidly.</p>

<p>I told her what had happened, and how
the mistake had occurred. I was never
very remarkably tactful; and, even if I
had been, any other explanation than the
truth would have been difficult.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/illus-0058.jpg" width="520" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THE EXPLANATION TOOK SOME LITTLE TIME."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"So you supposed," she answered, "that
I should have allowed young men to call
on me at a late hour?"</p>

<p>That was rather a poser, and I made no
answer.</p>

<p>"Your excuse," she went on, "only confirms
my previous opinion of you. You
have deliberately forced yourself on a crazy,
motherless child, who does not understand
the ways of the world, nor, I regret to say,
what is due to herself."</p>

<p>"I have done nothing of the kind," I
said, indignantly.</p>

<p>"I might have known that it was degrading
myself to talk to an attorney's
clerk," she said, with an awful emphasis on
the last two words. Then she strode away.</p>

<p>That evening the piano began again, but
I sat stolidly and endured it. After all,
there was something in what the old lady
said. The strumming continued for an
hour, and then stopped. In a few minutes
the servant brought me a note.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Arbuthnot,</p>

<p>"I cannot understand when a
banker is liable for a forged cheque.</p>

<p>"Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Marjorie Ormerod</span>."</p>

<p>I wrote back to say that I had had
an interview with her aunt, and appended
the law on the subject of forged
cheques. My note had not been dispatched
more than five minutes when
a knock came at the door, and Miss
Ormerod walked in.</p>

<p>"Mr. Arbuthnot," she said,
"will you kindly tell me the
meaning of this note?"</p>

<p>"I thought I had made
my meaning clear," I answered.
"A banker&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was not referring to
bankers," she replied, "but
to what you say about my
aunt."</p>

<p>"I supposed she would
have told you," I said. "She
did me the honour of visiting
me this afternoon, and&mdash;well&mdash;she
suggested that there were conventionalities."</p>

<p>"She's been gossiping with my servant,"
she exclaimed; "but why do
you pay any attention to what she
says?"</p>

<p>"You see," I ventured to protest,
"there are conventionalities."</p>

<p>"Conventionalities," she replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
firmly, "are some of the things that I do
not intend to have in my life. If I were
a man, and I wished to&mdash;to ask you a polite
question about forged cheques, wouldn't
you answer it?"</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"'I HEAR YOU HAVE BEEN FORCING
YOUR ATTENTIONS ON MY NIECE.'"</p></div>
</div>

<p>As a matter of fact, if a man had asked
for instruction under pain of playing the
piano, I think I should have refused; but
to say no would have resulted in embarrassing
explanations of my previous readiness
to enlighten her. So I replied diplomatically&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps so."</p>

<p>"Then," she said,
"I insist on your coming
upstairs at once.
You will insult me, Mr.
Arbuthnot, if you refuse."</p>

<p>Since she put it in
that way, I was compelled
to give in, however
much I agreed
with the old lady.
When I had finished
my exposition of the
law, Miss Ormerod expounded
some of her
theories of life, with
autobiographical illustrations.
The fundamental
theory seemed
to be that a girl ought
to be allowed to do
anything without
taking the consequences.
As a deduction
from this great
truth, she had decided
to live alone and become
a London University
Portia. At one
time she had intended to pursue her ambitions
at an Oxford college, but inquiry
had revealed the fact that the girls there
were still in swaddling clothes. It was
only in London, and in a flat, that the
true woman&mdash;she disclaimed the term new
woman&mdash;could possibly realise herself.
Most of her life she had spent in the
country, a fact which I might have guessed.
One of the main fallacies which the true
woman was going to expose, and which
had been intruded on her that night, was
the notion that no girl could associate
with a man without some foolish idea of
love-making. This fallacy she denounced
vigorously, and, as I thought, with a purpose.
It was naturally not a conversation
in which I could take much part, and I
listened mostly in silence.</p>

<p>The situation was more unpleasant than
the piano. It was hard to avoid further
interviews, and at the same time I knew
that I ought to do so. The little girl had
contracted some diseased modern notions,
and I had no business to aid and abet her.
However, if she persisted in regarding it
as an insult for me to
do my duty, I saw no
alternative but to acquiesce.
I could only
hope that in future she
might find fewer difficulties
in the law. In
this hope I was disappointed.
Regularly for
the next fortnight the
piano demanded instruction
every evening,
and with more
and more misgiving I
obeyed it. The fact
was that I felt myself
beginning to take a
disquieting interest in
her, and at the end of
the fortnight I acknowledged
frankly to myself
that, as far as concerned
me at least, her
favourite fallacy had
been proved true.</p>

<p>Matters were in this
condition, and were already
sufficiently complicated,
when a further
complication was
added to them. Shortly
after my arrival home
one evening, a person
of Hebraic appearance was shown in, who
announced himself as Mr. Hart.</p>

<p>"Good evening," he began, greasily;
"I have been consulted by Miss Prentice
in regard to a rather delicate matter. Miss
Prentice has, I believe, already spoken to
you on the subject."</p>

<p>"Has she?" I inquired. "Who is Miss
Prentice?"</p>

<p>"She is the aunt of Miss Ormerod, the
young lady who lives above you," he went
on. "She informs me that at her interview
with you she found you&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;unreasonable."</p>

<p>"Well?" I said curtly, for I disliked
the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now," he continued, "of course we
know that Miss Ormerod, though holding
these peculiar views, is a young lady possessed
of a considerable fortune&mdash;not very
large, but considerable."</p>

<p>"Do we?" I answered. "I know nothing
of the kind."</p>

<p>"Come, come," he said, "let us talk as
men of the world&mdash;in a friendly way&mdash;but
as men of the world."</p>

<p>"If you'd kindly tell me the object of
your visit, I should be obliged," I replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can quite see your point of view,"
he said, with an oily leer. "Miss Ormerod,
being, as I say, possessed of some fortune&mdash;not
so large as some people might suppose,
but some fortune&mdash;her relations are
naturally anxious that she should not marry
without seeing a little more of the world
than&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;can be seen in these
flats."</p>

<p>"Are you incapable of saying what you
mean, sir?" I inquired, with gathering
suspicion.</p>

<p>"As a brother professional, you must
know that things cannot always be put
crudely," he said. "Of course, Miss Prentice
is not a lady to be parsimonious where
her niece is in question. At the same
time, she is not a lady of unlimited
means. I may, however, remind you,
Mr. Arbuthnot, that a bird in the
hand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean," I burst out angrily,
"that I am supposed to be attempting
to inveigle Miss Ormerod into a marriage,
and that you've come here to
offer me a bribe?"</p>

<p>"Gently, Mr. Arbuthnot, gently,"
he protested.</p>

<img src="images/illus-0060.jpg" width="388" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"'WILL YOU KINDLY LEAVE THE ROOM AT ONCE?'
I ROARED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Will you kindly leave the room at
once?" I roared.</p>

<p>"I was afraid this might happen,"
he answered, "so we made a few inquiries
and took precautions. There
are such things, Mr. Arbuthnot, as
unpaid Oxford debts, eh? And tradesmen
are sometimes so distrustful as to
sell those debts. Now, here's a tailor's
bill&mdash;dear me, where's the schedule?
Yes, a tailor's bill for £57 odd."</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?" I
said.</p>

<p>"And you can have all these bills and a
little ready money," he went on, "if you'd
only be reasonable."</p>

<p>"Get out!" I exclaimed again.</p>

<p>"Do be reasonable, Mr. Arbuthnot," he
purred on, "or otherwise I may be compelled
to follow my instructions and sue,
and&mdash;I regret to say it&mdash;sell you up, and
prevent your inhabiting this delightful little
flat any longer."</p>

<p>"I give you just one minute," I said,
taking out my watch.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, very well," he answered;
"a gold watch&mdash;I must remember that."</p>

<p>I sat down and cursed that elderly spinster.
The position was quite delightful.
Those bills, as far as I remembered them,
amounted to something over £300; and, if
my uncle discovered their existence, my
prospects of a partnership, and probably
even my allowance, would be at an end.
Never having been at a university himself,
he held strong views on the subject of getting
into debt. That evening the piano
played again, and I went up to explain
Miss Ormerod's difficulties as usual. With
dramatic irony, they concerned the sale of
goods.</p>

<p>Borrowing the money was out of the
question, and I resolved desperately to
allow the law to take its course, and to
spend the few remaining days in Miss
Ormerod's company as far as I could.
Our legal discussions, and sometimes our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
discussions on other things, became more
protracted, but the time went swiftly, and in
the course of a fortnight or so there was a
man in possession. Probably if that elderly
spinster had been gifted with any capacity
for sitting tight, I should now be in South
Africa, but as I sat burning my letters preparatory
to the sale, Miss Ormerod burst in.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"'I'M VERY ANGRY,' SHE SAID."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Mr. Arbuthnot," she said, "I should
like to have a few words with you. I'm
very angry."</p>

<p>I followed her meekly.</p>

<p>"My aunt has been here this afternoon,"
she began, when we had reached her flat,
"and I hear that you are in debt, and that
your furniture is going to be sold."</p>

<p>"It is quite true," I said, wearily. "You
see, I got into debt at Oxford&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm a fool?" she asked,
indignantly. "What has my aunt got to
do with it?"</p>

<p>"Your aunt?" I answered. "What
should she have to do with it? I suppose
someone informed her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You suppose nothing of the kind," she
answered, hotly. "I know why; she told
me. It was because she disapproved of&mdash;of
your tuition, and I'm sure she had something
to do with this, or she wouldn't
have been so pleased with herself. I know
my aunt only too well. On your word
of honour, isn't she concerned in this,
Mr. Arbuthnot?"</p>

<p>"What in the world," I replied, attempting
to parry the question, "should a respectable
elderly lady like your aunt have
to do with debt-collecting?"</p>

<p>"There are very few things," she answered,
"with which my aunt has not to do
if she gets within measurable distance of
them. Now, will you please
explain?"</p>

<p>"How can I," I said, "if
there's nothing to explain?"</p>

<p>"I think you told me the
other night," she answered, "that
<i lang="la">suppressio veri</i> sometimes amounts
to <i lang="la">suggestio falsi</i>."</p>

<p>"Miss Ormerod," I said, "I've
got a lot of letters to burn to-night,
and I am rather busy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," she observed,
"then I must find out for myself."</p>

<p>She hurried down to my flat
along the passage, and burst
open the kitchen door. The
sheriff's man had already drained
the beer-cask, and was sitting smoking
with his feet on the kitchen range.</p>

<p>"Now," Miss Ormerod remarked,
"please tell me why
you're here."</p>

<p>"If you open your mouth,"
I broke in, "I'll throttle you."</p>

<p>"You're a witness, young
lady," the man said, "he's threatened to
assault an officer of the law in the execution
of his duty."</p>

<p>"Perhaps this might soothe your feelings,"
Miss Ormerod said, slipping something
into his hand.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a sovereign to hold your
tongue," I exclaimed, desperately.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," he said, "hand it
over."</p>

<p>"I'll give it you to-morrow," I replied.
As a matter of fact my cash in hand
amounted to some fifteen shillings.</p>

<p>"Oh, I daresay," he replied, with a grin.
"Make it five shillings more, young lady."</p>

<p>He got the five shillings, and then began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
as though he were unfolding a portentous
secret.</p>

<p>"I'm in for a matter of £300 recovered
in the action of Prentice <em>versus</em> Arbuthnot."</p>

<p>There was no false delicacy about Miss
Prentice; she had gleefully sued as assignee
in her own name.</p>

<p>"Miss Ellen Prentice?" Miss
Ormerod asked, quickly.</p>

<p>"I fancy that's the name,"
he said, searching among some
greasy papers.</p>

<p>"Oh, that will do," Miss
Ormerod replied, with a flushed
face. "Mr. Arbuthnot, I want
to speak to you."</p>

<p>She swept upstairs again,
and I accompanied her in silence.</p>

<p>"Now, perhaps," she remarked,
"you'll be good enough
to tell me the truth."</p>

<p>I told her a part of it, including
the visit of my Hebraic friend,
but I omitted his suggestions of
the matrimonial objects of my
visits. Miss Prentice's proceedings,
I suggested, were all due
to her regard for the conventionalities
and her niece's welfare.</p>

<p>"Of course," she began, sitting
down and taking a chequebook
from a drawer, "you'll
let me lend you this money."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," I
said, "but it's quite out of the
question."</p>

<p>"How preposterous!" she exclaimed,
in astonishment. "If
a man were to offer you the
money&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very likely," I said; "you
are not a man."</p>

<p>"But what difference in the world can
that make?" she inquired, indignantly.</p>

<p>"In the world," I said, "it makes a
considerable difference."</p>

<p>"But we've been friends, Mr. Arbuthnot,"
she said, appealingly, "and this is
my fault. Won't you take this wretched
money to please me?"</p>

<p>"I'd do most things to please you," I
answered, "but I can't do this."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand," she said, in a
half-broken voice, and looked at me dolorously
for a moment or two.</p>

<p>"Will you be able to be a solicitor after
this?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't thought about things
yet," I answered.</p>

<p>"Surely you might tell me," she said,
tearfully; "I think I've ruined your life."</p>

<p>"Miss Ormerod," I remarked, getting
up, "what's happened was my own fault,
and you're not to blame in the least; but
I think it would be better if I went down to
my place and finished looking things over."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"'PLEASE TELL ME WHY YOU'RE HERE,' SAID MISS ORMEROD
TO THE SHERIFF'S MAN."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Oh, but I can't let you go like this,"
she pleaded, tearfully; "it's so silly of you.
I've got such a lot of money, and surely
you'll do me a favour and let me lend you
a little of it."</p>

<p>"It's out of the question," I said.</p>

<p>"And," she pursued, a little timorously,
"how am I to get through my examination
if you won't help me? You've helped
me so much, Mr. Arbuthnot, you really
have."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," I said, holding out my hand.</p>

<p>"It's cruel of you, very cruel," she went
on, without noticing it; "and&mdash;and you
don't seem to mind in the least."</p>

<p>"What's done is done. Good-bye," I
said again.</p>

<p>"And I suppose you'll go somewhere&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>quite
away from this?" she continued,
"quite far away?"</p>

<p>"Probably," I said.</p>

<p>"But don't you mind&mdash;at all?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It's not particularly pleasant," I admitted.</p>

<p>"We've been good friends, haven't we?"
she said, with a little quiver of her lips.</p>

<p>"The best of friends," I agreed.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said, holding out her
hand.</p>

<p>As I took it our eyes met, and she drew
her hand back. It was hard, under the
circumstances, not to look something more
than the best of friends.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she said, "that you refused
to take that money because&mdash;because it
would have hurt your self-respect."</p>

<p>"I think so," I answered.</p>

<p>"Well," she went on, slowly, and half
turning away, "girls have their
self-respect too."</p>

<p>"What manner of man must
you think I am?" I asked,
understanding a little what she
meant, but refusing to take
advantage of what I thought
the little girl's mistaken chivalry.</p>

<p>"And what manner of girl must
you think me?" she replied,
and burst out crying.</p>

<p>"Don't think I don't understand
and don't appreciate,"
I said, lamely.</p>

<p>"Go away, go away," she
sobbed.</p>

<p>"I can't go," I said, "till
I have explained. I don't
quite know how to, but our
friendship began with bills of
exchange, and don't you think
a debtor would sometimes prefer
not to have an acceptance
for honour when he cannot pay
his debts?"</p>

<p>"It depends," she said, softly,
and with a lamentable disregard
of the law, "whether it's supra
protest."</p>

<p>"Don't tempt me too far," I urged.</p>

<p>"I am not tempting you," she said,
getting up and turning on me angrily.</p>

<p>"If you only knew," I protested, bitterly,
and her face changed.</p>

<p>"How am I to know," she asked, "if
you refuse to tell me?"</p>

<p>"What right have I?" I burst out.</p>

<p>"A right," she murmured, "implies an
obligation, and of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Well, well, the rest of the conversation
was commonplace except to ourselves.
The man in possession exhausted most of
my capital in getting extremely drunk
that night, my uncle insisted for the first
time in his life in regarding me as a clever
fellow after all, and Miss Prentice has
been confirmed in her opinion that I am a
scheming scoundrel.</p>

SOME CHARMING LINKS IN THE ANGLO-AMERICAN ALLIANCE.</h2>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Those</span> who scout the notion of an Anglo-American
Alliance should remember that
in a considerable number of cases the question
has been solved, and in a very satisfactory
manner, by the contracting parties themselves.
Every year Anglo-American marriages become
more frequent, and there can be no doubt that,
on more than one occasion, this fact has told
significantly when affairs of moment were in
question.</p>

<p>In this matter, at least, the United Kingdom
has remained faithful to her "oldest colony,"
and latterly distinguished Englishmen have sought
wives in America, rather than in Greater Britain.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 280px;">

<div class="caption"><p>MRS. ARTHUR PAGET.</p>

<p class="right"><i>J. Thomson, Photo</i></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>At the present time three of the most prominent
personalities in the House of Commons&mdash;Mr.
Joseph Chamberlain, Sir William Harcourt,
and Mr. George Curzon&mdash;are each married to an
American, and the only difficulty that meets those
who would attempt to draw up a list of these
informal Anglo-American alliances is to choose
from the large number of names that presents
itself. To take the peerage only, there are
at the present time three American duchesses, and
Lady Francis Hope (Miss May Yohe) may one
day be Duchess of Newcastle. The only transatlantic
marchioness is Lady Anglesey, but there
are three American countesses, four baronesses,
and many other ladies whose husbands are in
possession of courtesy titles.</p>

<p>Of the three American ladies who have worn
and are wearing the strawberry leaves, perhaps
the most interesting, from several points of view,
is the lady who is still known to the world as
Lilian, Duchess of Marlborough.</p>

<p><i lang="fr">Née</i> Miss Price, the future duchess was married
when very young to a
wealthy American, Mr. Hammersley.
His death occurred
comparatively soon after the
marriage, and he left his young
wife his entire fortune. Some
years later, she greatly astonished
her friends by marrying
the then Duke of Marlborough;
but, contrary to
general expectation, no part
of her immense fortune was
squandered, for Her Grace
proved herself an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
woman of business, and though considerable
sums were spent on putting and
keeping Blenheim in repair, it was
arranged that an insurance covering
the whole amount should, in each case,
be effected on the duke's life. Consequently,
at his death, his widow found
herself an even wealthier woman than
she was before she became his wife.</p>

<p>After the
late Duke of
Marlborough's
death,
the duchess
lived very
quietly; but,
as she was
still a comparatively
young woman,
her
marriage to
Lord William
Beresford
was considered
to be,
on her part,
a very judicious
step.
Her stepson,
the
young Duke
of Marlborough,
gave
her away,
and she has
remained on
very good
terms with
her second
husband's
family.</p>

<p>Lord William
Beresford
was believed,
until
comparatively
lately, to
be a confirmed
Anglo-Indian,
for he
managed, as
Military Secretary, the households of several
Viceroys, and he is known, both
among Europeans and Indians all over
the Queen's Eastern Empire, as a man
possessing not only exceptional business
capacity, but remarkable <i lang="fr">savoir faire</i>.
He has taken part in many campaigns,
and was the prototype of "Soldier Bill"
in one of Whyte Melville's best known
novels.</p>

<p>Since his marriage, he and his wife have
lived at the Deep Dene, Lord Francis Hope's
beautiful place near Dorking, and it was
there that their infant son was born last
year. The duchess has adapted herself
completely to the conditions of English
country life.
The Deep
Dene was
described by
Aubrey as
"an epitome
of Paradise,"
and a "Garden
of Eden."
Accordingly,
the lines of
Lord William
Beresford
and his
wife are laid
in pleasant
places. The
latter devotes
a good deal
of her time
to the collection
and
growth of orchids.
Under
her supervision
a fine
orchid-house
has been
erected, and
she is fast
becoming a
formidable
rival to the
most noted
growers in
the kingdom.</p>

<p>At the present
moment
the personality
of Consuelo,
Duchess
of Manchester,
as she will henceforth be known, is
of peculiar interest. Although the engagement
of the young duke was lately announced,
his mother is still one of the
youngest looking women in society, and she
has scarcely changed since the day, twenty-two
years ago, when she took London by
storm as the bride of Viscount Mandeville,
the then Duke of Manchester's eldest son
and heir.</p>

<p>Unlike most Americans who have married
Englishmen, Miss Consuelo Yznaga
had only once paid a flying visit to London
before her marriage. Her mother, who had
been a noted belle of New Orleans in the
fifties, on her marriage to a distinguished
Spaniard went to Cuba, where the future
British duchess was born in the little
village of Sant Espiritu.</p>

<p>As has been the case with almost every
family connected with Cuba, the Yznagas
sustained great losses, which led to their
settling once more in America, and it was
there that Miss Yznaga first met Lord
Mandeville, then travelling in the States.
When visiting at her father's house he
fell ill, and was very kindly nursed and
entertained till his recovery. The engagement
excited exceptional interest owing
to the fact that Lady Mandeville, as she
became, was the first Anglo-American
peeress.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that after their marriage
Lord and Lady Mandeville had no
London house, the latter soon took a very
prominent place in society; she became a
great favourite both with the Prince and
with the Princess of Wales, and she was
constantly included in the lists of house
parties invited to meet their Royal Highnesses.</p>

<p>Many years of Lady Mandeville's married
life were spent in Ireland. She was devoted
to her three children, twin daughters
and one son, known during his childhood
as Lord Kimbolton; and though she
often paid flying visits to London, she did
not revisit America for a long time.</p>

<p>On the death of the seventh Duke of
Manchester, in 1890, Lady Mandeville became
at once the reigning Duchess of
Manchester, and she was for a time the
only American duchess in the peerage;
during the two years which elapsed before
the duke's death, the duchess gave a
series of splendid entertainments both in
her London house in Great Cumberland
Street, and at Kimbolton Castle, in Huntingdonshire,
the splendid place which was,
for so many years, the home of poor
Catherine of Arragon after her divorce
from Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Her mother-in-law, now the Duchess of
Devonshire, always proved a firm and
loyal friend to her son's beautiful American
wife; and on the death of the eighth
duke, which occurred in the August of
1892, it was his mother who persuaded the
young duchess that she should continue
to live in London, and not retire, as she
thought of doing, to her son's Irish seat.</p>

<p>The greatest grief of the Duchess of
Manchester's life was the death of Lady
Mary Montagu, one of her beautiful twin
daughters, whose charming portraits by
Lady Granby and Mr. Edward Hughes
have made their features familiar. Since
her death, which occurred very suddenly
in Rome, the duchess has lived very
quietly until this spring, only emerging
from her retirement in order to introduce
her young daughter to society.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the young
Duchess of Marlborough, <em>née</em> Miss Vanderbilt,
is the godchild and namesake of Consuelo,
Duchess of Manchester, owing to
the circumstance that the latter and Mrs.
Vanderbilt were intimate friends. The
Duke of Marlborough first met Miss
Vanderbilt when she was visiting her
godmother, but the engagement and
marriage took place, as all the world
knows, in New York.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Marlborough, like most
of her fellow countrywomen, has shown
remarkable powers of adaptability. She
is very much liked, both round Blenheim
and in the more critical London world
where her rank gives her a very important
place.</p>

<p>Everyone is aware that Lady Randolph
Churchill is one of three beautiful sisters
who all married Englishmen. The brilliant
younger son of a Duke of Marlborough
first met Miss Jennie Jerome in Paris.
Like so many American women, she was
and is a very excellent conversationalist; in
fact, during Lord Randolph's lifetime, it
used to be said that the only woman who
was his match in repartee was his own
wife. Although brought up in an intensely
republican atmosphere, she developed,
after her marriage, into an enthusiastic
Tory, and a pillar of the Primrose
League.</p>

<p>When her husband decided to enter
Parliament, his wife set herself to promoting
his interests in every way; and it was
openly averred at the time, that he owed his
appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer
to her efforts, for in those days
Lady Randolph Churchill may be said to have
had a <em>salon</em> in the true sense of the word, and
her beautiful house in Connaught Place
was a rendezvous for her husband's friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
and supporters. She showed American
thoroughness in everything about the establishment,
keeping the best <em>chef</em> in town
and being a perfect hostess from every
point of view.</p>

<p>Since the premature death of Lord Randolph
Churchill, his widow has continued
to make her home in London. She is very
devoted to
her two sons,
and is said to
be as ambitious
for them
as she was for
their father.
It was at one
time widely
asserted that
Lady Randolph
was about to
become the second
wife of her millionaire
fellow-countryman,
Mr. William Waldorf Astor,
but up to the present time the rumour has
not been confirmed.</p>

<p>Lady Randolph's great interest in life is
music. She is a very fine pianist, and
sings almost as well as she talks. She has
of late devoted a great deal of her spare
time to private theatricals, her first appearance
having taken place at Blenheim,
during the now historical visit of the
Prince and Princess of Wales to the Duke
of Marlborough and his young American
bride.</p>

<p>Lady Randolph has preserved an extraordinary
look of youth, and, though the
eldest of the three, she looks younger
than either of her sisters, Mrs. Jack
Leslie, and Mrs. Morton Frewen.</p>

<p>Among the American
women who have been
called upon to take an
active interest
in British political
life,
Mrs. Joseph
Chamberlain
certainly
deserves
the
foremost
place. She
is devoted to
her husband,
and has made
herself thoroughly
conversant
with all that affects
or that may
affect his political
ambitions. But she is quite content&mdash;unlike,
it must be admitted, most American
women&mdash;to take a second place, and she is
liked and respected by many people who
still retain their prejudice against the
Colonial Secretary.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chamberlain, <em>née</em> Miss Mary Endicott,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
belongs to one of the oldest families
in New England, one of her forebears
having been the first English governor of
Massachusetts. Mr. Chamberlain, then a
widower for the second time, first met Miss
Endicott in 1887, when he was one of
the British delegates on the Fishery Commission;
but their engagement did not
take place till the following year, and
Mr. Chamberlain returned to America to be
married, the wedding being celebrated at
Salem, Mass., the residence of the bride's
father.</p>

<p>At the present moment it is interesting
to recall that Mr. W. C. Endicott was
Secretary for War in President Cleveland's
first administration, and perhaps
Mr. Chamberlain's openly expressed sympathies
with America during the Hispano-American
war are greatly owing to the
fact that his wife's family have always
been ardently patriotic.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chamberlain has now become quite
an Englishwoman. Her husband's people
have become her people, and she has even
gathered Birmingham to her heart, for
although Highbury has become a very
"smart" house, its mistress is always
ready to welcome there her husband's old
supporters and early friends; Mrs. Chamberlain
has also ever been on the happiest
terms with her step-children, one of whom,
Mr. Austen Chamberlain, is older than
herself.</p>

<p>What orchids are popularly supposed to
be to the Colonial Secretary, roses are to
his charming American wife; and the
rosery at Highbury is one of the most
beautiful in the United Kingdom, and this
although Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlain spend
a considerable portion of the year in
Prince's Gardens, where they are always
reminded, however, of their much-loved
Warwickshire home, great baskets full of
roses being sent them almost daily from
Highbury.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chamberlain does not see very much
of what may be called the American colony.
On all important occasions she is to be
seen in the Ladies' Gallery of the House of
Commons, and during the famous Home
Rule Bill debates she was as faithful in her
attendance as was Mrs. Gladstone herself.
She is one of the very few American women
for whom the Queen has shown a distinct
partiality, and she often accompanies her
husband when he receives a "dine and
sleep" invitation to Windsor.</p>

<p>Lady Harcourt belongs to an altogether
older and more serious generation than that
from which have been drawn those American
women who now leaven English
society. She was the daughter of the
famous American historian, Motley, and
much of her youth was spent in Europe,
where her father, who was a diplomat
as well as a student, was seeking
materials for his great history, "The Rise
of the Dutch Republic."</p>

<p>Miss Motley married Mr. Ives when quite
a girl, and after becoming a widow continued
to live in England; and thus it fell
about that Mr. Vernon Harcourt, himself a
widower with one little boy, had the good
fortune to win as his second wife one of the
most charming and kindly of women.</p>

<p>The Liberal ranks are, when compared
with their rivals, poor in hostesses; but it
is universally admitted that in Lady Harcourt
they are exceptionally blessed, and
her house parties at Malwood have done
much to make Sir William popular with
the party, the more so that Lady Harcourt
does not confine her interest to politics.
She is devoted to literature and art, and
accordingly she is very eclectic in her
choice of guests. Thus Sir William and
Lady Harcourt were on intimate terms with
Disraeli, and after the great Tory leader's
death, a very valuable and unique miniature
of Byron which had been in the
possession of the author of "Lothair" was
given to the Squire of Malwood by Lord
Beaconsfield's executors.</p>

<p>Lady Harcourt also frequently entertained
Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone, and in her
garden is a walnut tree planted by the
Grand Old Man, while close by is an ash
which is known as Mrs. Gladstone's tree.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that, through the
Vernons, Lady Harcourt is the only
American who can claim relationship with
Royalty. The story goes that on one occasion,
to his annoyance rather than to
his amusement, a friend of the Liberal
Leader once proposed at a Radical gathering
the health of "Mr. Vernon Harcourt
and the rest of the Royal Family!"</p>

<p>Mrs. George Curzon is the latest addition
to the group of American women
which is now playing so prominent a part
in English political society. The future
Lady Scarsdale is the daughter of a
great Chicago millionaire, whose home,
however, has now been for many years
in Washington. It was said at the time
of the marriage that Mr. Leiter had settled
on his daughter £10,000 a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>As Miss Leiter, Mrs. Curzon spent
several winters in Europe, and she met
her future husband first in London, although
their engagement and marriage
took place at the bride's own home in
Washington. Even in America, that land
of beautiful women, Miss
Leiter was distinguished for
her exceptional good looks,
and she was also said to
be, as a girl, one of the best
conversationalists in Washington.
Owing
to her intimate
friendship with
Mrs. Cleveland,
she was constantly
at the
White House,
and while there
became acquainted
with all
the diplomatic
world; indeed,
at one time
every foreign
attaché in Washington
was said
to aspire to the
honour of becoming
Miss
Leiter's husband.
She speaks
French and German
perfectly,
and has always
been interested
in literary matters;
indeed,
her interest in
Mr. George Curzon's
literary
work first caused
them to become
friends. Their
engagement lasted
some months, and aroused
great interest throughout the
States.</p>

<p>The marriage took place in Washington
four years ago, and ever since Mrs. George
Curzon has entirely identified herself with
her husband's aims and interests. When
he was standing for Southport she was the
most energetic of canvassers, and her beautiful
London house is becoming quite a
rendezvous of the Conservative party.</p>

<p>Of all the American women who have
married Englishmen none has a more interesting
house than has the Countess of
Essex; indeed, Cassiobury Park, which is
near Watford, is not only one of the
loveliest country houses in the United
Kingdom, but is said to date its name
and fame from the days of the early Britons.
The house itself is of recent construction,
having been built by Inigo
Jones, while the gardens were laid out by
Le Nôtre, who was persuaded to leave
Versailles for a brief period in order that he
might lend his aid to beautifying the property
of the
Lord Capel from
whom the present
Earl of
Essex is descended.</p>

<p>Lady Essex,
<em>née</em> Miss Adele
Grant, has
fine taste. Her
special hobby
is the collecting
of miniatures,
and in
her boudoir at
Cassiobury are
over a hundred
exquisite portraits
of the dead
and gone beauties
and beaux of
a former day.
Curiously
enough, the title
of Countess of
Essex has been
invariably borne
by a beautiful
woman, and one
of the most
charming pictures
in the house
is a portrait of
the lovely Kitty
Stephens, who
became the wife
of the fifth earl.</p>

<p>The Countess of Essex, although belonging
to a well-known American family,
has lived in London from her earliest girlhood,
and she was at one time regarded as
the prospective bride of the late Lord
Cairns. Her marriage, five years ago, to
the seventh Earl of Essex was a social
sensation of 1893.</p>

<p>COUNTESS OF
ESSEX AND BABY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Lord and Lady Essex are both keenly
interested in sport and in animals. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
have no town house, but entertain a great
deal in their beautiful Hertfordshire place.</p>

<p>The young Countess of Craven is the
daughter of an immensely wealthy American
couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bradley Martin;
even before their daughter's marriage, they
generally spent half the year in Europe,
and their entertainments and house parties
became notable for almost "Ouidaesque"
lavishness. Mrs. Bradley Martin
possesses the most valuable collection of
jewels belonging to any American woman.
Her rubies alone are valued at £40,000, and
a fan which she gave her daughter, and
which is encrusted with pearls, rubies,
emeralds, and diamonds, is intrinsically
worth £2,000.</p>

<p>Since the marriage of Miss Cornelia
Bradley Martin to the fourth Earl of
Craven, the young American countess has
taken a prominent place among the country
hostesses of the day. She has already entertained
Royalty several times.</p>

<p>One of the most attractive American
women who have made their home on this
side of the Atlantic is Lady Terence
Blackwood, the pretty young daughter-in-law
of the Marquis of Dufferin. Before
her marriage, Miss Flora Davis was for
some time a member of the American
colony in Paris, and her marriage took
place while Lord Dufferin still occupied
the British Embassy.</p>

<p>Miss Davis, though the daughter of a
very wealthy man, was not, in the ordinary
sense of the word, an heiress; and since
her marriage she and her husband, who is
Lord Dufferin's second son, have lived
quite quietly either in a pretty flat in Paris,
or more lately in Cadogan Square, where
their house is one of the prettiest in
London, each room representing a different
period, the curious and valuable furniture
having been a present from Lady Terence's
father.</p>

<p>Lady Naylor-Leyland is the most beautiful
American in society. As Miss Jennie
Chamberlain her loveliness was the talk of
two continents, and her beauty has an
exquisite setting in her present London
house, for her father-in-law was one of the
foremost art collectors in Europe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arthur Paget takes a very leading
place among the American women who
have made England their home, for to exceptional
loveliness she joins great vivacity
and charm of manner. This latter quality
is probably owing to the fact that her
mother, Mrs. Paran Stevens, was always
surrounded in New York by a circle of intellectual
and interesting people.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arthur Paget is celebrated for her
wonderful collection of jewels, which includes
a rope of the largest pearls in the
world. She is also very fond of emeralds,
and is often seen wearing a tiara of these
beautiful stones. Like Lady Naylor-Leyland,
she is a very successful London
hostess, and she has revived the fashion of
<em>poudré</em> and fancy dress balls. Colonel Paget
is a cousin of Lord Anglesey.</p>

<p>The same year that witnessed the marriage
of the Earl of Essex to Miss Adele
Grant witnessed another interesting Anglo-American
alliance, that of Miss Mary
Caroline Cuyler to Sir Philip Grey-Egerton.
Lady Grey-Egerton, who is the proud
mother of twin sons, born two years after
her marriage, is very fond of society. She
is an enthusiastic cyclist.</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">"I abominate</span> detective stories," said
the Q.C., laying down his cue along
the corner of the billiard-table and going
across to the shelf where the cigar-boxes
stood. "You see, when a man makes a
detective story to write down on paper, he
begins at the butt-end and works backwards.
He notes his points and manufactures
his clues to suit 'em, so it's all bound
to work out right. In real life it's very
different,"&mdash;he chose a Partaga, looking
at it through his glasses thoughtfully&mdash;"and
I ought to know; I've been studying
the criminal mind for half my working
life."</p>

<p>"But," said O'Malley, "a defending
counsel is a different class of animal from
the common detective."</p>

<p>"Oh, is he?" said the Q.C.; "that's all
you know about it." He dragged one of
the big chairs up into the deep chimney
corner and settled himself in it, after
many luxurious shruggings; then he spoke
on, between whiffs at the Partaga.</p>

<p>"Now I'll just state you a case, and
you'll see for yourself how we sometimes
have to ravel out things. The
solicitor who put the brief in my hands
was, as solicitors go, a smart chap. He
had built up a big business out of nothing,
but criminal work was slightly out of his
line. He had only taken up this case to
oblige an old client, and I must say he
made an uncommonly poor show of it. I
never had such a thin brief given me in my
life.</p>

<p>"The prisoner was to be tried on the
capital charge; and if murder really had
been committed, it was one of a most
cold-blooded nature. Hanging would follow
conviction as surely as night comes on
the heels of day; and a client who gets
the noose given him always damages his
counsel's reputation, whether that counsel
deserves it or not.</p>

<p>"As my brief put it, the case fined down
to this:</p>

<p>"Two men got into an empty third-class
smoking compartment at Addison Road.
One of them, Guide, was a drain contractor;
the other, Walker, was a foreman in
Guide's employ. The train took them
past the Shepherd's Bush and Grove Road
Hammersmith stations without anything
being reported; but at Shaftesbury Road
Walker was found on the floor, stone dead,
with a wound in the skull, and on the seat
of the carriage was a small miner's pickaxe
with one of its points smeared with blood.</p>

<p>"It was proved that Guide had been
seen to leave the Shaftesbury Road station.
He was dishevelled and agitated at the
time, and this made the ticket collector
notice him specially amongst the crowd of
out-going passengers. After it was found
out who he was, inquiries were made at
his home. His wife stated that she had
not seen him since Monday&mdash;the morning
of Walker's death. She also let out that
Walker had been causing him some annoyance
of late, but she did not know about
what. Subsequently&mdash;on the Friday,
four days later&mdash;Guide was arrested at the
West India Dock. He was trying to obtain
employ as coal trimmer on an Australian
steamer, obviously to escape from the
country. On being charged he surrendered
quietly, remarking that he supposed it was
all up with him.</p>

<p>"That was the gist of my case, and the
solicitor suggested that I should enter a
plea of insanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 435px;">
<img src="images/illus-0073.jpg" width="435" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THE TICKET COLLECTOR SPECIALLY NOTICED HIM."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Now, when I'd conned the evidence
over&mdash;additional evidence to what I've told
you, but all tending to the same end&mdash;I
came to the conclusion that Guide was as
sane as any of us are, and that, as a defence,
insanity wouldn't have a leg to stand upon.
'The fellow,' I said, 'had much better
enter a plea of guilty and let me pile up a
long list of extenuating circumstances. A
jury will always listen to those, and feeling
grateful for being excused a long and
wearisome trial, recommend to mercy out
of sheer gratitude.' I wrote a note to this
effect. On its receipt the solicitor came to
see me&mdash;by the way, he was Barnes, a
man of my own year at Cambridge.</p>

<p>"'My dear Grayson,' said he, 'I'm not
altogether a fool. I know as well as you
do that Guide would have the best chance
if he pleaded guilty; but the difficult part
of it is that he flatly refuses to do any such
thing. He says he no more killed this
fellow Walker than you or I did. I pointed
out to him that the man couldn't very
conveniently have slain himself, as the
wound was well over at the top of his head,
and had obviously been the result of a most
terrific blow. At the P.M. it was shown
that Walker's skull was of abnormal thickness,
and the force required to drive
through it even a heavy, sharp-pointed
instrument like the pickaxe, must have
been something tremendous.</p>

<p>"'I tell you, Grayson, I impressed
upon the fellow that the case was as
black as ink against him, and that he'd
only irritate the jury by holding out;
but I couldn't move him. He held
doggedly to his tale&mdash;he had not killed
Andrew Walker.'</p>

<p>"'He's not the first man who's stuck
to an unlikely lie like that,' I remarked.</p>

<p>"'The curious part of it is,' said
Barnes, 'I'm convinced that the man
believes himself to be telling the absolute
truth.'</p>

<p>"'Then what explanation has he to
offer?'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 511px;">
<img src="images/illus-0073a.jpg" width="511" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"GUIDE WAS ARRESTED AT THE WEST INDIA DOCK."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"'None worth listening to. He owns
that he and Walker had a fierce quarrel
over money matters, which culminated
in a personal struggle. He knows that
he had one blow on the head which
dazed him, and fancies that he must
have had a second which reduced him
to unconsciousness. When next he
knew what was happening, he saw
Walker lying on the floor, stone dead,
though he was still warm and supple.
On the floor was the pickaxe, with one
of its points slimy with blood. How it
came to be so he couldn't tell. He
picked it up and laid it on a seat.
Then in an instant the thought flashed
across him how terribly black things looked
against himself. He saw absolutely no
chance of disproving them, and with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
usual impulse of crude minds resolved at
once to quit the country. With that idea
he got out at the Shaftesbury Road Station,
and being an ignorant man and without
money, made his way down to the Ratcliff
Highway&mdash;beg its pardon, St. George's
High Street. Using that as a centre, he
smelt about the docks at Limehouse and
Millwall trying for a job in the stokehold;
but as that neighbourhood is one of the
best watched spots on earth, it is not a
matter for surprise that he was very soon
captured. That's about all I can tell you.'</p>

<p>"'I'm afraid it doesn't lighten matters
up very much.'</p>

<p>"'I never said it would. The gist of
this is down in your brief, Grayson. I
only came round
to chambers because
of your letter.'</p>

<p>"'Still,' I persisted,
'you threw
out a hint that
Guide had offered
some explanation.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes; but
such a flimsy, improbable
theory
that no sane man
could entertain it
for a minute. In
fact, he knew it to
be absurd himself.
After pressing him
again and again to
suggest how
Walker could have
been killed (with
the view of extorting
a confession),
he said, in his slow, heavy way,
"Why, I suppose, Mr. Barnes, someone
else must ha' done it. Don't you think as
a man could ha' got into the carriage whilst
I was lying there stupid, and hit Walker
with the pick and got out again afore I
come to? Would that do, sir?"</p>

<p>"'I didn't think,' added Barnes, drily,
'that it was worth following that theory
any deeper. What do you say?'</p>

<p>"I thought for a minute and then spoke
up. 'Look here, Barnes; if in the face of
this cock-and-bull story Guide persists in his
innocence, there may be something in it after
all; and if by any thousand-to-one chance
we could bring him clear, it would be a red
feather in the caps of both of us. Do you
object to my seeing the man personally?'</p>

<p>"'It's a bit irregular,' said Barnes,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"'I know it is bang in the teeth of
etiquette. But suppose we compromise,
and you come with me?'</p>

<p>"'No, I won't do that. My time's busy
just now; and besides, I don't want to
run up the costs of this case higher than
necessary. But if you choose to shove
your other work aside and waste a couple
of hours, just go and interview him by
yourself, and we'll waive ceremony. I'll
get the necessary prison order, and send
it round to you to-morrow.'</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"THEY HAD A FIERCE QUARREL OVER MONEY MATTERS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Next afternoon I went down to see
Guide in the waiting-room at the Old
Bailey. He was a middle-aged man,
heavy-faced, and evidently knocked half
stupid by the situation in which he found
himself. He was perhaps as great a fool
to his own interests as one might often
meet with. There was no getting the
simplest tale out of him except by regular
question-and-answer cross-examination.
What little he did tell seemed rather to
confirm his guilt than otherwise; though,
strange to say, I was beginning to believe
him when he kept on assuring me between
every other sentence that he did not commit
the murder. Perhaps it was the stolid
earnestness of the fellow in denying the
crime which convinced me. One gets to
read a good deal from facial expression
when a man has watched what goes on in
the criminal dock as long as I have done;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
and one can usually spot guilt under any
mask.</p>

<p>"'But tell me,' I said, 'what did you
quarrel about in the first instance?'</p>

<p>"'Money,' said Guide, moodily.</p>

<p>"'That's vague. Tell me more. Did
he owe you money?'</p>

<p>"'No, sir, it was t'other way on.'</p>

<p>"'Wages in arrear?'</p>

<p>"'No, it was money he had advanced
me for the working of my business. You
see Walker had always been a hard man,
and he'd saved. He said he wanted his
money back, he knowing that I was pinched
a bit just then and couldn't pay. Then he
tried to thrust himself into partnership with
me in the business, which was a thing I
didn't want. I'd good contracts on hand
which I expected would bring me in a
matter of nine thousand pounds, and I
didn't want to share it with any man, least
of all him. I told him so, and that's how
the trouble began. But it was him that
hit me first.'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus-0075.jpg" width="530" height="444" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HE KEPT ON ASSURING ME THAT HE DIDN'T
COMMIT THE MURDER."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"'Still, you returned the blow?'</p>

<p>"Guide passed a hand wearily over
his forehead. 'I may have struck him
back, sir&mdash;I was dazed, and I don't rightly
remember. But before God I'll swear that
I never lifted that pick to Andrew Walker&mdash;it
was his pick.'</p>

<p>"'But,' I persisted, "Walker couldn't
very conveniently have murdered himself.'</p>

<p>"'No, sir, no&mdash;no, he couldn't. I
thought of that myself since I been in here,
and I said to Mr. Barnes that perhaps
somebody come into the carriage when I
was knocked silly, and killed him; but
Mr. Barnes he said that was absurd.
Besides, who could have done it?'</p>

<p>"'Don't you know anybody, then, who
would have wished for Walker's death?'</p>

<p>"'There was them that didn't like him,'
said Guide, drearily.</p>

<p>"That was all I could get out of him,
and I went away from the prison feeling
very dissatisfied. I was stronger than ever
in the belief that Guide was in no degree
guilty, and yet for the life of me I did not
see how to prove his innocence. He had
not been a man of any strong character to
begin with, and the shock of what he had
gone through had utterly dazed him. It
was hopeless to expect any reasonable
explanation from him; he had resigned
himself to puzzlement. If he had gone
melancholy mad before he came up to
trial, I should not have been one whit
surprised.</p>

<p>"I brooded over the matter for a couple
of days, putting all the rest of my practice
out of thought, but I didn't get any forwarder
with it. I hate to give anything
up as a bad job, and in this case I felt that
there was on my shoulders a huge load of
responsibility. Guide, I had thoroughly
persuaded myself, had not murdered Andrew
Walker; as sure as the case went
into court, on its present grounding, the
man would be hanged out of hand; and I
persuaded myself that then I, and I alone,
should be responsible for an innocent
man's death.</p>

<p>"At the end of those two days only one
course seemed open to me. It was foreign
to the brief I held, but the only method
left to bring in my client's innocence.</p>

<p>"I must find out who did really murder
the man. I must try to implicate some
third actor in the tragedy.</p>

<p>"To begin with, there was the railway
carriage; but a little thought showed me
that nothing was to be done there. The
compartment would have been inspected
by the police, and then swept and cleaned
and garnished, and coupled on to its train
once more, and used by unconscious passengers
for weeks since the uproar occurred
in it.</p>

<p>"All that I had got to go upon were the
notes and relics held at Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"The police authorities were very good.
Of course, they were keen enough to bring
off the prosecution with professional <em>éclat</em>;
but they were not exactly anxious to hand
over a poor wretch to the hangman if he
was not thoroughly deserving of a dance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
on nothing. They placed at my disposal
every scrap of their evidence, and said that
they thought the reading of it all was plain
beyond dispute. I thought so, too, at first.
They sent an inspector to my chambers
as their envoy.</p>

<p>"On one point, though, after a lot of
thought, I did not quite agree with them.
I held a grisly relic in my hand, gazing at
it fixedly. It was a portion of Walker's
skull&mdash;a disc of dry bone with a splintered
aperture in the middle.</p>

<p>"'And so you think the pickaxe made
that hole,' I said to the inspector.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"'YOU THINK THE PICKAXE MADE THAT HOLE,' I SAID TO THE INSPECTOR."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"'I don't think there can be any doubt
about it, Mr Grayson. Nothing else could
have done it, and the point of the pick was
smeared with blood.'</p>

<p>"'But would there be room to swing
such a weapon in a third-class Metropolitan
railway carriage?'</p>

<p>"'We thought of that, and at first it
seemed a poser. The roof is low, and both
Guide and Walker are tall men; but if
Guide had gripped the shaft by the end, so,
with his right hand pretty near against the
head, so, he'd have had heaps of room to
drive it with a sideways swing. I tried
the thing for myself; it acted perfectly.
Here's the pickaxe: you can see for yourself.'</p>

<p>"I did see, and I wasn't satisfied; but I
didn't tell
the inspector
what I
thought. It
was clearer
to me than
ever that
Guide had
not committed
the
murder.
What I
asked the
inspector
was this:
'Had either
of the men
got any luggage
in the
carriage?'</p>

<p>"The inspector
answered, with
a laugh, 'Not quite, Mr.
Grayson, or you would
see it here.'</p>

<p>"Then I took on
paper a rough outline
of that fragment of bone, and an accurate
sketch of exact size of the gash in it, and
the inspector went away. One thing his
visit had shown me. Andrew Walker was
not slain by a blow from behind by the
pickaxe.</p>

<p>"I met Barnes whilst I was nibbling
lunch, and told him this. He heard me
doubtfully. 'You may be right,' said
he, 'but I'm bothered if I see what you
have to go upon.'</p>

<p>"'You know what a pickaxe is like?' I
said.</p>

<p>"'Certainly.'</p>

<p>"'A cross-section of one of the blades
would be what?'</p>

<p>"'Square&mdash;or perhaps oblong.'</p>

<p>"'Quite so. Rectangular. What I want
to get at is this: it wouldn't even be diamond
shape, with the angles obtuse and
acute alternately.'</p>

<p>"'Certainly not. The angles would be
clean right-angles.'</p>

<p>"'Very good. Now look at this sketch
of the hole in the skull, and tell me what
you see.'</p>

<p>"Barnes put on his glasses, and gazed
attentively for a minute or so, and then
looked up. 'The pick point has crashed
through without leaving any marks of its
edges whatever.'</p>

<p>"'That is to say, there are none of your
right-angles
showing.'</p>

<p>"'None.
But that
does not go
to prove
anything.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>"'No. It's only about a tenth of my
proof. It gives the vague initial idea. It
made me look more carefully, and I saw
this'&mdash;I pointed with my pencil to a
corner of the sketch.</p>

<p>"Barnes whistled. 'A clean arc of a
circle,' said he, 'cut in the bone as though
a knife had done it. You saw that pickaxe.
Was it much worn? Were the
angles much rounded near the point?'</p>

<p>"'They were not. On the contrary, the
pick, though an old one, had just been
through the blacksmith's shop to be re-sharpened,
and had not been used since.
There was not a trace of wear upon it: of
that I am certain.'</p>

<p>"Barnes whistled again in much perplexity.
At length said he, 'It's an absolutely
certain thing that Walker was not
killed in the way they imagine. But I
don't think this will get Guide off scot-free.
There's too much other circumstantial
evidence against him. Of course you'll do
your best, but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'It would be more than a toss up if I
could avoid a conviction. Quite so. We
must find out more. The question is, how
was this wound made? Was there a third
man in it?'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 530px;">

<div class="caption"><p>"LOOK AT THIS SKETCH OF THE HOLE IN THE SKULL."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"'Guide may
have jobbed him
from behind with
some other instrument,
and afterwards
thrown it
out of window.'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said I,
'but that is going
on the assumption
that Guide did the
trick, which I don't
for a moment think
is the case. Besides,
if he did
throw anything out of window, it would
most assuredly have been found. They
keep the permanent way very thoroughly
inspected upon the Metropolitan. No,
Barnes. There is some other agent in this
case, animate or inanimate, which so far
we have overlooked completely; and an
innocent man's life depends upon our ravelling
it out.'</p>

<p>"Barnes lifted his shoulders helplessly,
and took another sandwich. 'I don't see
what we can do.'</p>

<p>"'Nor I, very clearly. But we must start
from the commencement, and go over the
ground inch by inch.'</p>

<p>"So wrapped up was I in the case by
this time, that I could not fix my mind
to anything else. Then and there I went
out and set about my inquiries.</p>

<p>"With some trouble I found the compartment
in which the tragedy had taken
place, but learnt nothing new from it. The
station and the railway people at Addison
Road, Kensington, were similarly drawn
blank. The ticket inspector at Shaftesbury
Road, who distinctly remembered Guide's
passage, at first seemed inclined to tell me
nothing new, till I dragged it out of him
by a regular emetic of questioning.</p>

<p>"Then he did remember that Guide had
been carrying in his hand a carpenter's
straw bass, as he passed through the
wicket. He did not recollect whether he
had mentioned this to the police: didn't
see that it mattered.</p>

<p>"I thought differently, and with a new
vague hope in my heart, posted back to
the prison. I had heard no word of this
hand-baggage
from Guide. It remained
to be seen
what he had done
with it.</p>

<p>"They remembered
me from my
previous visit, and
let me in to the
prisoner without
much demur.
Guide owned up
to the basket at
once. 'Yes,' he
said, 'I had some
few odd tools to
carry from home,
and as I couldn't
find anything else
handy to put them
in I used the old
carpenter's bass. I had an iron eye to
splice on to the end of a windlass rope, a job
that I like to do myself, to make sure it's
done safe. I never thought about telling
you of that bass before, sir. I didn't see
as how it mattered.'</p>

<p>"'Where is the bass now?'</p>

<p>"'In the Left Luggage Office at
Shaftesbury Road Station. Name of
Hopkins. I've lost the ticket.'</p>

<p>"'Where did you put your basket on
entering the carriage at Addison Road?'</p>

<p>"'On the seat, sir, in the corner by the
window.'</p>

<p>"And with that I left him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Now,' thought I, 'I believe I can find
out whether you murdered Walker or not,'
and drove back to Hammersmith.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus-0078.jpg" width="530" height="463" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"A DISCOLORATION WHICH I KNEW TO BE DRIED
HUMAN BLOOD."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I inquired at the cloak-room. Yes,
the carpenter's bass was there, beneath a
dusty heap of other unclaimed luggage.
There was demurrage to pay on it, which
I offered promptly to hand over, but as I
could produce no counterfoil bearing the
name of Hopkins, the clerk, with a smile,
said that he could not let me have it.
However, when he heard what I wanted,
he made no objection to my having an
overhaul.</p>

<p>"The two lugs of the bass were threaded
together with a hammer. I took this
away, and opened the sides. Within was
a ball of marline, another of spun-yarn, a
grease-pot, and several large iron eyes.
Also a large marline-spike. It was this last
that fixed my attention. It was brand new,
with a bone handle and a bright brass
ferrule. Most of the iron also was bright,
but three inches of the point were stained
with a faint dark brown. From a casual
inspection I should have put this down to
the marline-spike having been last used to
make a splice on tarred rope; but now my
suspicions made me think of something else.</p>

<p>"I raised the stained point to my nose.
There was no smell of tar whatever. On
the bright part there was the indefinable
odour of iron; at the tip, that thin coat of
dark brown varnish had blotted this scent
completely away.</p>

<p>"I think my fingers trembled when I
turned to the bass again.</p>

<p>"Yes, there, opposite to where the point
of the marline-spike had been lying&mdash;it was
tilted up over the ball of spun-yarn&mdash;was a
closed-up gash in the side of the bass.
The spike had passed through there, and
then been withdrawn. Round the gash
was a dim discoloration which I knew to
be dried human blood.</p>

<p>"In my mind's eye I saw the whole
ghastly accident clearly enough now. The
two men had been standing up, struggling.
Guide had gone down under a blow,
knocked senseless, and Walker had stumbled
over him. Pitching forward, face
downwards, on to the seat before he could
recover, his head had dashed violently against
the carpenter's bass. The sharp
marline-spike inside, with its heel resting
against the solid wall of the carriage, had
entered the top of his skull like a bayonet.
No human hand had been raised against
him, and yet he had been killed.</p>

<p>"I kept my own particular ramblings
in this case remarkably quiet, and in court
led up to my facts through ordinary cross-examination.</p>

<p>"At the proper psychological moment I
called attention to the shape of the puncture
in Walker's skull, and then dramatically
sprang the bass and the marline-spike
upon them unawares. After that, as
the papers put it, 'there was applause in
court, which was instantly suppressed.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, the conceit of the man," said
O'Malley, laughing.</p>

<p>Grayson laughed too. "Well," he said,
"I was younger then, and I suppose I was a
trifle conceited. The Crown didn't throw
up. But the jury chucked us a 'Not
guilty' without leaving the box, and then
leading counsel for the other side came
across and congratulated me on having
saved Guide from the gallows. 'Now I'd
have bet anything on hanging that man,'
said he."</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Incrimination</span> by handwriting, if

<div class="caption"><p>SIGNATURE OF THE CLAIMANT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It appears that sixteen or seventeen years
ago an elderly gentleman named James
Whalley was living at Leominster. He
passed his days at the home of a man
named Thomas, a petty municipal functionary,
leading a decidedly frugal, not to
say miserly, life. Whalley had two children,
Emma and Henry Whalley Priestman,
whom he educated and lived with until
about the year 1877, when he quarrelled
with his daughter and left her and her
brother at Hereford, he himself going to
live at Thomas's cottage at Leominster.
On the seventh of May 1881, he died,
leaving between fifty and sixty thousand
pounds. A will was produced, bearing the
old man's indubitable signature, as well as
the signature of witnesses, in which the
bulk of the fortune was left to Thomas,
the son being cut off with £5,000. Everything
seemed plain and above-board, but
certain circumstances were suspicious,
and the document was
contested. This famous will, of
which a photograph has been
specially taken for the present
article, was brought into court
and submitted to the scrutiny
of experts, accustomed to detect
the most minute flaws in the
work of the cleverest forger. They
were obliged to give it as their
opinion that the signatures were
all genuine&mdash;the document itself
being in the hand of one of the
attesting witnesses. But when
it came to examining the will
carefully as a whole, it was found
by one expert that
there was cause for
suspicion. The attesting
clauses were
rather curiously
cramped at the side,
giving from their position
the idea to the
expert's mind that
they had been added
subsequently, with
a view to accommodating
the signature.
The signature
itself, too, had a date
under it, a peculiarity
of the testator's
in writing a
letter, but never
found elsewhere. The lines varied,
too, as though the writer had begun
in the belief that there had been
ample room. Everything now
seemed to point to the fact of a
will written over and around a
signature, and not to a signature
naturally written at the bottom of
a will. Meanwhile, there had appeared
in different parts of the
paper certain odd marks and formations.
Early in the inquiry the
will had been glazed and framed;
and now left to itself the paper,
as it were, began to speak and
declare itself other than what it
seemed. Soon these marks and
formations took the shape of
words and fragments of words, and
by a powerful magnifying glass
could even be read. It was now
sufficiently clear for the expert to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
declare that these were hollows and shades
caused by pencil marks made by one of
the attesting witnesses and principal legatee,
and afterwards rubbed out.</p>

<img src="images/illus-0081a.jpg" width="330" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>MURDERER'S OFFER TO ACT AS DETECTIVE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is a well-known fact, in connection
with palimpsests, that time will often recall
a writing long believed to have been
obliterated. Erase the writing as carefully
as is possible, till all trace of pencil or pen
has vanished, yet with most kinds of paper
one will really only have erased the immediate
marks of the plumbago or ink. The
indentations on the paper will remain,
merely filled up with the dust and surface
of the material rubbed over them. This
is what occurred here. The testator, it
was proved at the subsequent trial, believing
himself to be <i lang="la">in extremis</i>, desired
the presence of his son. At his request
the principal legatee had written for him
the letter, taking the precaution of writing
it in pencil&mdash;being equally careful, at the
same time, that the signature should be
in ink. The rest of the proceeding was
simple: the pencil was rubbed out, and
over the signature the will was written.
It was proved that the will in which he
left almost the whole of his property to his
son was done away with, and Thomas
and Nash were convicted.</p>

<p>The next document we present was
produced by the public prosecutor in
court at the trial of William Palmer,
the poisoner, in 1856. It is a page from a
diary discovered by the police among the
guilty man's effects at Rugeley. In this
diary each of Palmer's numerous murders
was chronicled, together with most of the
details of his personal association with his
victims, of whom John Parsons Cook was
the last. Having denied that he had been
with Cook on the Sunday and Monday in
question, this diary, in the murderer's own
handwriting, were other evidences not forthcoming,
convicted him of falsehood&mdash;and
(on a post-mortem examination, first of one
victim and then another) of murder. He
expiated his crime at length on the scaffold.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>LETTER FROM NEILL CREAM THE POISONER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But a more celebrated case than either
of those we have yet mentioned was that
surrounding the claimant to the Tichborne
estates. It is almost needless to recapitulate
the circumstances of this great
action, in which Arthur Orton, a butcher's
apprentice, sought to pass himself off as
the long missing Roger Charles Tichborne.
But throughout all the sophistries by which
Orton sought to strengthen his case there
were three documents which, in the jury's
eyes, annulled all the efforts of his counsel.
These three documents consist of, first,
the handwriting of the real Sir Roger
Charles Tichborne; second, of the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
who claimed to be he; and third, of Arthur
Orton. A moment's glance, even by those
unpractised in the art of analysing and comparing
handwriting, sufficed to show that
the hand which had written the "Arthur
Orton" letter was the same hand that had
sent from the Metropolitan Hotel, Sydney,
the affectionate letter to Lady Tichborne.
But as to any real affinity between these
letters and the admittedly genuine one
signed by "Roger Charles Tichborne" in
1852, there is none whatever.</p>

<p>There are two cases of recent celebrity
which relate to wilful
murder, and in
which documents
played an important
part. Few can have
forgotten the trial
and conviction of
Thomas Neill Cream. We publish photographs
of papers in the guilty man's
handwriting which figured in that case.
This wretched man seems to have murdered
his victims in order to blackmail others for
the crime. The first example is a letter to
the deputy-coroner, which reads like the
epistle of a madman, but which sheds
considerable light on the methods Cream
might adopt; the second is a specimen of
Cream's "backhand," in which he identifies
himself with the family of one of his victims.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 458px;">
<img src="images/illus-0082b.jpg" width="458" height="198" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The second of the two cases mentioned
is that of James Canham Read. It will be
recalled that in this murder trial a telegram
was produced which clinched the
evidence against the prisoner by destroying
his contention of <em>alibi</em>. This telegram,
which speaks for itself, is now in the possession
of the Scotland Yard authorities.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE TELEGRAM THAT HANGED JAMES CANHAM READ.</p></div>
</div>

<p>What we know now as an impudent
forgery, but what was then regarded by
many as a terribly incriminating document,
is the famous "Parnell letter," published
by the <cite>Times</cite> in 1888. It would seem that
the very circumstance of the cramped
writing at the bottom of the first page
would have aroused suspicion. The signature
is, of course, genuine, Mr. Parnell
having written on a sheet of paper, without
dreaming what use was to be made of it by
unscrupulous parties.</p>

which discovered him; for
one of the articles of
every Briton's faith is
that so long as he speaks
in English he can safely
say what he likes to these
foreign beggars. Therefore,
as this particular Portuguese had
nipped my ticket every morning for over
a week, with never more than a murmured
"<i lang="pt">Com licença, senhor</i>," when he avoided my

compartment.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blessed!" I remarked to
the others. "The fellow understands
English."</p>

<p>"Yes. Most Scotchmen do, you know,"
was the reply; and I felt smaller than ever.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Don't know. Calls himself Judson,
but probably was christened something
else. He has been on the Lisbon-Cintra
line for the last ten years, and that's
pretty nearly all that is known about him.
Half a score of fellows have tried at different
times to get him to talk, but he sees
through it, and closes up like an oyster."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?" I asked; for this
sounded interesting.</p>

<p>"You'll have to get him to tell you
himself; nobody else knows. Bet you
twenty mil you don't draw him."</p>

<p>"Done!" said I, and booked the bet.</p>

<p>Now, the more I allowed my thoughts
to dwell on the square, determined-looking
features of the man, the more angry
I grew with myself because I could
not put a name to the face. The fellow
haunted me the whole morning, and as the
dilatoriness of the Portuguese Government
officials, with whom I was trying to negotiate
a sugar concession, gave me plenty of
time for reflection, by the time I had become
thoroughly tired of hanging round
the Cortes, and had made up my mind to
having to wait once more for the interminable
Portuguese "to-morrow," I was
also quite ready for another interview
with "Judson." I set off, therefore, for the
station, and took my ticket to Cintra.</p>

</div>

<p>What was the man's real name? And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
where had I seen that rather wooden smile
before?</p>

<p>Ten years on the Lisbon-Cintra line,
they say. Then I must have been quite a
kid when I met him in England, if I ever
did meet him. Ten years&mdash;by Jove! can
it be Farquhar? Six feet two, determined
features, wooden smile&mdash;it <em>is</em> Farquhar!
Wonder how Nellie Conyers will take this
when I tell her. Doubtful, very! But on
second thoughts, <em>shall</em> I tell her? H-m!
I don't know.</p>

<p>The point is that, although Mrs. Conyers
is my second cousin, she is also
a young widow, unencumbered;
and I am rather afraid of her.
She was engaged to Farquhar
before she met Conyers, but
the match was broken off because
of some Indian scandal
or other; something about the
Viceroy's Cup, I think. Farquhar
had a horse entered,
which won when it shouldn't,
or lost when it shouldn't&mdash;I
forget which. Anyway, there
was unpleasantness, and Farquhar
threw up his commission,
and offered to release
Nellie Vincent from her engagement.
She took him at
his word, and married the next
"eligible" who came along&mdash;Amos
Conyers, to wit, a Yorkshire
wool-comber, since deceased.
All things considered,
I thought perhaps I wouldn't
tell Mrs. Conyers.</p>

<p>But if Cousin Nellie inspired
me with awe, the Cintra ticket-examiner
didn't; so when the
door of the compartment
(which, as luck would have it,
I had to myself after we left
Rio de Mouro) suddenly
opened, and the familiar "<i lang="pt">Com
licença</i>" heralded the fact that my legs were
as usual in the way, I was prepared.</p>

<p>"Sir," I said, "I was rude to you this
morning, and I wish to apologise."</p>

<p>He looked hard at me for a moment;
then smiled, and shrugged his shoulders
slightly, Portuguese fashion.</p>

<p>"The senhor is pleased to make fun of
me," he answered, quietly.</p>

<p>"No; I'm in dead earnest," I declared.
"But whose pardon have I the honour to
beg&mdash;Captain Ian Farquhar's, shall I say?"</p>

<p>He turned on me at once, and the ticket-nippers
fell out of his twitching fingers and
clattered on the floor unheeded.</p>

<p>"Who told you that name?" he demanded,
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Nellie Vincent," said I, and watched
him narrowly, "used to speak pretty frequently
about a certain Ian Farquhar&mdash;that
is to say, before she became Mrs. Conyers,
of course&mdash;and I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he interrupted, with a
menacing gesture which was all English,
"and what do you know about Nellie
Vincent?"</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"'WHO TOLD YOU THAT NAME?' HE DEMANDED, FIERCELY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"As much as a not very distant relative
may know," I answered, suavely. "Can I
take her any message from Captain Farquhar?"</p>

<p>He turned sharply round, and I wondered
whether he was going to embrace me or
assault me. As a matter of fact, he did
neither.</p>

<p>"Go to the devil," he snarled savagely
in my face, and then, opening the door
with a jerk, swung himself out on to the
foot-board.</p>

<p>Now, we were on an incline, and going,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
for a Portuguese local train, really fast.
Under ordinary circumstances, therefore,
he would have waited till we slowed down
at the station before venturing to pass on
to the next carriage; but a badly surprised
man forgets that he's got a neck to be broken.</p>

</div>

<p>"I've a notion
I shall win
those twenty
mil," said I to
myself, as I
picked up the
nippers he had
dropped.
"Anyhow, the
Captain will
have to return
for this little
implement."</p>

<p>The engine
gave a couple
of piercing
shrieks; the
guard leaned
out and blew
his penny
trumpet; the
station-master's
bell could
be heard ringing
furiously ahead of us; and all this unnecessary
noise merely meant that we were
entering Cintra station. Just before we
came to a standstill, Farquhar paid me the
visit I was waiting for.</p>

<p>"My nippers," he explained, nervously,
poking his head in at the window and
peering about; "I think I dropped them."</p>

<p>I handed the tool to him. He took it,
and then, with breathless haste, jerked out,
"Look here, I'm off duty at eight. Come
to my shanty if you can&mdash;pink-washed hut
just below the Quinta da Bella Vista.
Sorry I was rude to you just now."</p>

<p>Then he dropped off the foot-board, and
the train pulled up at the platform with a
clumsy jerk.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Yes," remarked Farquhar, contentedly,
"you're right. There are uglier spots in
the world than this."</p>

<p>Then he blew a couple of smoke-rings,
and watched them dissolve slowly in the
still air.</p>

<p>The sun was just disappearing behind
the club-shaped kitchen chimneys of the
Moorish palace, and the long, doleful
"<em>Wo-o-o-a-aw</em>" of the donkey men, who
were bringing a party of Spanish tourists
back from Montserrat and the Cork Convent,
floated across the lemons and roses
of the <em>quintas</em> below, and died away in the
silences above us, smothered by the heavy
curtain of pine needles.</p>

<p>"Does it satisfy you?" I asked, quietly.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;the scenery?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't mean that&mdash;you'd be a
captious brute if it didn't&mdash;but the life."</p>

<p>The man's brow contracted ominously,
and he threw away his cigar with unnecessary
energy.</p>

<p>"You're used to something better, you
see," I insinuated.</p>

<p>"And I am used to this," he replied,
shortly.</p>

<p>Then he dropped his chin on to his chest
and looked at me from under his brows.</p>

"I guess what you're driving

you may; but I don't remember you, and

</div>

<p>"Really," I began, "I have no
wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, man!" he interrupted,
and pointed excitedly to the panorama
around us. "Look about you, and say if
you know a better place for a poor devil of
a Pariah to bury himself
in! My hut is
comfortable;
the scenery is
perfect; that
<em>caldeirada</em> of
mullet and vegetables,
of which you
were pleased
to approve just
now, is a luxury
within reach
of even a railwayman's
wage, and the
cigar you are
smoking is one
of a case of
eight thousand Villar y Villars
which I brought with me when
I turned hermit. I don't smoke
more than one a day on an average,
so if you calculate you'll find
there are still over four thousand
left."</p>

<p>He got up, and paced the
gravel aggressively.</p>

<p>"Do you ever see an English
paper?" I asked, with sudden recollections
of an obituary notice.</p>

<p>The furrow on the ticket-nipper's brow
smoothed itself out; his movements lost
their irritable jerkiness, and when he spoke
the grating snarl had gone from his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, quietly, "I do. I
know that my father is dead, and that I
can call myself Sir Ian Farquhar if I choose
to. That's what you mean, isn't it? I
got a month's holiday and went and laid a
wreath on the old man's grave."</p>

<p>There was a catch in Farquhar's voice
as he told me this, and somehow I did not
care to break the pause which followed.</p>

<p>"But," he went on again, "what should
I gain by going home now? My title,
and the grouse moors which go with it,
would gain me friends&mdash;of a sort. I know
that; but do you imagine that it would be
forgotten for a moment that I had to
resign my commission because of a hocussed
racehorse? Would Mrs. Conyers, for instance,
allow me to visit her?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, decidedly;
but I wasn't sure.</p>

<p>"You think so?
You don't know
her, then; and if
she would I
shouldn't go&mdash;can't
you see that?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why
you shouldn't," I
contended.</p>

<p>Sir Ian laughed
bitterly as I
spoke.</p>

<p>"You don't?
No, of course you
don't! You've
never heard a man
call you a cheat
and not had the
power to call him
a liar in return. A
few experiences of
that sort develop
one's shyness,
you'd find. I shall
never go home
till&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Till Nellie
Conyers asks you
to," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"No," he answered,
"not that; I stick to possibilities.
I was merely going to say that I wouldn't
go home until I could give the lie to
every man in my old regiment. Looks as
if I should stay here some time, doesn't
it?"</p>

<p>"You can clear yourself," I suggested.</p>

<p>"No," he retorted, "I can't."</p>

<p>I didn't believe him.</p>

<p>"Look here," I said; "I'm going
home next week. Will you give me a
brief?"</p>

<p>"What, to vindicate my reputation?
Yes, if you don't care about your own.
They won't believe you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll risk that," said I; for I had a
notion that my cousin Nellie, at all events,
might, perhaps, be convinced.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As soon as possible after my arrival in
England, I went and told my tale to
Mrs. Conyers. I met her at a crush in
Hans Place, and engaged her to sit out
three consecutive dances with me. To
give me these she had, so she said, to
disappoint two very nice boys indeed; but
I insisted. My tale would take three dances
at least in the telling, and, moreover, it
concerned Ian Farquhar; so, with a pout&mdash;Nellie's
pouts were a part of her ordnance,
and, of course, suited her&mdash;she consented.</p>

<p>As it happened, we sat out not three
dances, but five; for after I had said my
say, she also had something to tell&mdash;and
of the two hers was the better tale, for it
made Farquhar into a hero.</p>

<p>I knew that Nellie's brother had been a
lieutenant in Farquhar's
regiment, but
I did not know that
the responsibility for
the foul running
in the Viceroy's Cup
was conclusively
proved to lie between
Captain Farquhar
and Lieutenant
Vincent. Vincent
denied it stoutly;
Farquhar, engaged
to Vincent's
sister, said nothing.
So Farquhar became
the Cintra ticket-nipper,
and Vincent
remained with
his regiment until
the native moneylenders
made India
too hot to hold him.
Then he resigned,
and, socially speaking,
went under.</p>

<p>Nellie had learned
the facts from one of her "nice boys," a
"sub" who had taken over Vincent's sayce
after the smash, and was still too young
to know when to hold his tongue. The sayce
let out that Vincent Sahib had bribed him
to drug the racehorse.</p>

<p>"And so, you see," said Nellie to me,
"poor Ian was a hero after all. It was for
my sake, you know, that he wouldn't speak."</p>

<p>I said something appropriate.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Nellie, with a
blush. "Please ask them to call my
carriage; I want to go home. And you
might come to-morrow and talk things
over with me&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;book a passage
to Lisbon by the next mail&mdash;you'll want it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm&mdash;astonished," said I; but I
wasn't.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"My dear fellow," said Farquhar to me,
when I visited him again in his Cintra
hut, "I don't want to be rude to you,
but I'd much rather you let me alone.
I've broken with the old life, you see, and
you must allow that you are out of place in
the new one. You'll pardon my speaking
so plainly."</p>

<p>"Sir Ian Farquhar," said I, "light one
of those Villar y Villars and sit down and
listen to me. After you've heard what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
have to say, I'll never visit you again until you
ask me."</p>

<p>I told him my tale, and he heard it through
without showing by a flicker how it affected him.</p>

<p>"Now," said I, when I had finished, "what are
you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Bid you good-night," he answered,
shortly. "I work the first train to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Man!" I exclaimed, in amazement,
"Nellie Conyers wants you&mdash;she
sent me to say so."</p>

<p>"Does she? Then she can come
and say so herself."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, that's unreasonable," I
began; but a flutter
of skirts at the door
interrupted me.</p>

<p>"I couldn't wait
any longer," said
my cousin Nellie,
pleadingly. "Ian,
you'll come back
to England with me?"</p>

<p>I picked up my
hat and went for a
stroll. When I returned
the door was closed, and
Nellie was waiting outside.</p>

<p>"Don't go in,"
she commanded.
"He sent me out
to wait till he'd
changed out of his
railway clothes.
He has hunted an
old Poole suit out
of his trunk, and is putting it on."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE WHICH WOULD NOT GO.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Three</span> apparently hopeless quests have
engaged the abilities of inventors and
scientists from a very early period&mdash;the
Philosopher's Stone, that should convert
everything it touched into pure gold; the
Elixir of Life, that once partaken of should
invest the recipient with immortality on
earth; and Perpetual Motion.</p>

<p>To the average man it is a self-evident
fact that unless you put energy or force of
some sort into a machine it won't work.
Thus, a locomotive will not move unless
you apply steam or electricity, nor a bicycle
unless the muscular energy of your own
body propels it. But, simple as this fact
may seem, there have been, from early
times, as we have indicated, men whose
whole object in life has been to construct
a machine that, once started, shall run for
ever by its own momentum. There are
such people to-day; and it is pathetic to
think what an immense amount of inventive
genius has been expended on projects that
we may declare to be absolutely hopeless of
achievement, even in these days of
phonographs and wireless telegraphy.</p>

<p>"Why can't it be done?" says the
Inventor. Many reasons to the contrary
might be adduced, but the most cogent
answer to the practical man lies in this
great fact, that up to the present not a
single perpetual motor has ever yet been
seen at work&mdash;that is to say, no machine
has ever yet been invented which, when
once started, would work for an indefinite
time without a corresponding amount of
energy being given it.</p>

<p>Careful experiment and daily observation
all point to one comprehensive principle&mdash;that
you cannot get out of a machine
more work than you put into it. In the
locomotive, for example, the work given
out when it is in operation is exactly
equivalent to the energy stored up in
the inert coal cast into the furnace. Although
this principle in all its scientific exactitude
is less than a century old, yet its truth is
now so well settled, that nothing short of
an actual working perpetual motor could
demonstrate its falsity. The search for
the Philosopher's Stone, the production of
an Elixir of Life, have, like the hope of
an El Dorado, been consigned to the limbo of
forgotten things. Nevertheless, in spite of
science, aspirations after the Perpetual
Motor still burn fitfully.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>ANOTHER INGENIOUS FAILURE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Some, indeed the vast majority, of the
chimerical methods for getting work for
nothing, are being rediscovered day by day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
and, as before, cast aside. An almost incredible
amount of wasted labour and
fruitless effort have been devoted to this
subject. The quest, however, ever seems
to be fresh and attractive, and year after
year in wearying succession continues to
allure, as the records of the Patent Office
show, a never ending train of deluded enthusiasts.</p>

<p>A few of the typical methods that have
been imagined for consummating the desired
end are here introduced. One of the
simplest methods consists in the use of a
wheel, divided into a series of spoke-like
boxes, each of which contains a rolling
ball. Since the balls on the falling side of
the wheel are farther from the centre, it is
clearly seen (on paper) that the weights
act with greater advantage on that side of
the wheel than on the other, and, of course,
will drag the wheel over, and this, as the
balls roll (so far as anything is seen to the
contrary by the designer), should continue
indefinitely. An excellent theory&mdash;but,
sad to relate, the most exquisitely constructed
machine of this pattern ceases to turn after a few revolutions.</p>

<p>The propounder of
perpetual motion theories
does not always
confine himself to diagrams,
but sometimes
deludes himself in a
cloud of verbiage.
Here is a sample. "Let
us," says the theorist,
"construct a wheel of
immense dimensions. On
one side of it, let
there be hung a huge
mass. On the opposite
side suspend innumerable small
weights. Then shall it be found
that the wheel will continually
revolve. For when the huge mass
is at the top, its weight will cause
it to descend. Why is this? The
answer is obvious&mdash;because it is so
heavy. In the meantime the innumerable
small weights will reach
the top, and thereupon <em>they</em> will
descend. Why is <em>this</em>? The
answer again is clear&mdash;because there are so
many."</p>

<p>Most excellent word juggling perhaps,
but it would scarcely impose on a child.
We cannot, however, avoid a shrewd suspicion
that the theorist in this instance has
done no more
than employ
a
method not
altogether foreign
to those
sometimes utilised
in much more serious,
recondite, and
difficult matters.
Passing on, we reach
an arrangement
where the balls are secured to hinged arms,
which, as the wheel turns round, fall open
on the one side and close up on the other.
Clearly the leverage is greater on one side,
so that the wheel <em>ought</em>
to revolve continually
when once started, and
to give out work which
could be transmitted by
driving bands or other
devices to operate
machinery.</p>

<p>In this example, and
indeed throughout this
article, we have not
troubled about practical
details of construction.
These, of course, do not
affect the principles involved. Much
ingenuity indeed has been shown in
their production, but the perpetual
motionist cannot claim in them an
exclusive property.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>SHOWING HOW JACK WORKS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The flopping-over arrangement
just described reminds one of the
"Tumbling Jack," a children's toy
one often sees on sale in the streets.
In this toy a series of bricks are
strung together in a chain. From
the ingenious way in which the bricks
are joined it results, as everyone who
ever seen it will at once remember,
that on holding the uppermost brick in the
hand and giving it an almost imperceptible
tilting movement, an apparently endless
series of bricks chase each other down the
chain. Each brick in succession tumbles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
over and imparts an impulse to the one
immediately below it, which in turn does
the same, and so the motion is carried from
one end of the chain to the other. Why
could not this everlasting tumbling-down
motion, which seemingly
is produced
without effort, be
turned to account?
It only needs the
chains to be sufficiently
multiplied in
point of size or
number to furnish
us with a source of
power which apparently
may be
made as large as we
desire. Considerations
of this kind
wear a plausible air.
But it may perhaps
be noticed that
when this particular
apparatus is working, it is always
held in the hand, and that our supposition
about increasing the size or number
of the chains would, as a consequence, carry
with it the necessity for having either an
army of persons, or a giant, to work the apparatus
in its complete form. No magic need
be invoked to explain the working powers of an
army or of a giant.</p>

</div>

<p>One has often heard of the miller who wished
to drive his water-wheel by the water which the
wheel pumped up to the "head-race," or supply
conduit. Well, here is such an arrangement
devised many centuries ago. On the
left of the picture the water-wheel is shown
receiving water raised by the "chain"
pump on the right, suitable gearing transmitting
the motion
of the wheel to the
pump.</p>

</div>

<p>Another class of
devices for getting
work out of a machine
which has
never been fed into
it may be illustrated
by what we may
term the "Grindstone"
paradox. Its
supposed action is
due to the well-known
fact that articles
when immersed
in a liquid tend to
float. Take a block of wood the shape
of a grindstone and immerse one half
of its mass in a vertical tank of water. The
flotative power of the water will cause
this half to rise continually, and to consequently
keep the block constantly
turning round its axle. We leave the
explanation of this paradox to the
reader. Sufficient is it to say here that,
alas! brutal experiment proves it will
not work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>Closely allied to the "Grindstone"
paradox is the "Concertina" machine,
where a series of weighted concertina-like
chambers attached to a band passing round
pulleys collapse when descending into a
tank of water, but expand, and therefore
become lighter, when the other side of the
band is reached. The expanded chambers
on the left of the picture act like a series of
corks, while on the right the closed
chambers act as dead weights. By this
means it was anticipated continuous rotary
movement would be obtained.</p>

</div>

<p>Another favourite scheme is to employ
the well-known property of liquids to rise
of their own accord against the force of
gravity when in microscopic channels, such
as are found in all porous bodies, this property
of rising being due to what is known
as "capillary attraction." For instance,
it is a matter of everyday observation that
oil ascends a wick, water passes up over
the edge of a basin through a towel which,
partially immersed in the water, hangs over
the side. Some idea of the enormous
power of this property of ascending is given
by a celebrated French <em>savant</em> who has
found that capillary action is capable,
under favourable circumstances, of exerting
a pressure four or five times as great as
that of the atmosphere, and who thinks
this is largely efficient in promoting the
ascent of sap in plants. Consequently, if
this natural uprising property of liquids
could be only laid hold of, the problem of
getting work for nothing, so thinks our
schemer,
would
thereby be
solved. We
have selected
for illustration
a
form of apparatus
where, on
the left, a
bundle of
flexible
sheets is
placed almost
in contact, so that the liquid into
which they are dipped rises in the microscopic
spaces between them. This provides
a "head" of water, which is expected to
overbalance the right hand of the system,
where the sheets have been separated by
the wires of a grid, or other equivalent, so
as to destroy the capillary action on that
side.</p>

<p>At the present time the public mind is
so greatly agitated on the subject of horseless
vehicles, that an illustration of the
perpetual motionist's ideas on the subject
is given. Here the weight of the vehicle
and its occupants bears upon water in
cylinders supported on the wheels. The
pressure produced in the water in this way
is conveyed by
means of pipes
to the back of
the carriage,
where it is employed
to push
the vehicle along.
Such speed the
inventor in this
case expected to
obtain, that, with
great forethought,
he has
provided a
"cow-catcher" at
the front, by
means of which
unfortunate persons
who inadvertently
get in
the way are to be
gently waived
aside. Of course,
the larger the number of people carried,
the greater the pressure on the water, and
hence, in the inventor's mind, so much
greater the speed.</p>

A STORY OF MISS VAN SNOOP, DETECTIVE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Clarence Rook.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Illustrated by Hal Hurst.</i></p>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Colonel Mathurin</span> was one of
the aristocrats of crime; at least
Mathurin was the name under which he
had accomplished a daring bank robbery
in Detroit which had involved the violent
death of the manager, though it was
generally believed by the police that the
Rossiter who was at the bottom of some
long firm frauds in Melbourne was none
other than Mathurin under another name,
and that the designer
and chief gainer in a
sensational murder
case in the Midlands
was the same mysterious
and ubiquitous
personage.</p>

<p>But Mathurin had
for some years successfully
eluded pursuit;
indeed, it was
generally known
that he was the
most desperate
among criminals,
and was determined
never
to be taken
alive. Moreover,
as he invariably
worked
through subordinates
who
knew nothing of
his whereabouts
and were scarcely
acquainted
with his appearance,
the police
had but a slender
clue to his
identity.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact,
only two people beyond
his immediate associates
in crime could have
sworn to Mathurin if
they had met him face
to face. One of them
was the Detroit bank
manager whom he had shot with his
own hand before the eyes of his fiancée.
It was through the other that Mathurin
was arrested, extradited to the States,
and finally made to atone for his life of
crime. It all happened in a distressingly
commonplace way, so far as the
average spectator was concerned. But
the story, which I have pieced together
from the details supplied&mdash;firstly, by a
certain detective
sergeant
whom I met
in a tavern
hard by Westminster;
and
secondly, by a
certain young
woman named
Miss Van
Snoop&mdash;has
an element of
romance, if
you look
below the
surface.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"HE SHOT THE BANK MANAGER

</div>

<p>It was
about half-past
one
o'clock, on
a bright
and pleasant
day,
that a
young lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
was driving down Regent Street in a hansom
which she had picked up outside her
boarding-house near Portland Road Station.
She had told the cabman to drive
slowly, as she was nervous behind a horse;
and so she had leisure to scan, with the
curiosity of a stranger, the strolling crowd
that at nearly all hours of the day throngs
Regent Street. It was a sunny morning,
and everybody looked cheerful. Ladies
were shopping, or looking in at the shop
windows. Men about town were collecting
an appetite for lunch; flower girls were
selling "nice vi'lets, sweet vi'lets, penny
a bunch"; and the girl in the cab leaned
one arm on the apron and regarded the
scene with alert attention. She was not
exactly pretty, for the symmetry of her
features was discounted by a
certain hardness in the set of
the mouth. But her hair, so
dark as to be almost black,
and her eyes of greyish blue
set her beyond comparison
with the commonplace.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus-0095.jpg" width="530" height="454" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THERE WAS A SLIGHT STIR OUTSIDE THE
CAFÉ ROYAL."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Just outside the Café Royal there was a
slight stir, and a temporary block in the
foot traffic. A brougham was setting down,
behind it was a victoria, and behind that a
hansom; and as the girl glanced round the
heads of the pair in the brougham, she saw
several men standing on the steps. Leaning
back suddenly, she opened the trapdoor
in the roof.</p>

<p>"Stop here," she said, "I've changed
my mind."</p>

<p>The driver drew up by the kerb, and
the girl skipped out.</p>

<p>"You shan't lose by the change," she
said, handing him half-a-crown.</p>

<p>There was a tinge of American accent
in the voice; and the cabman, pocketing
the half-crown with thanks, smiled.</p>

<p>"They may talk about that McKinley
tariff," he soliloquised as he crawled along
the kerb towards Piccadilly Circus, "but
it's better 'n free trade&mdash;lumps!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the girl walked slowly back
towards the Café Royal, and, with a quick
glance at the men who were standing there,
entered. One or two of the men raised
their eyebrows; but the girl was quite
unconscious,
and went on
her way to
the luncheon-room.</p>

<p>"American,
you bet," said
one of the
loungers.
"They'll go
anywhere and
do anything."</p>

<p>Just in front
of her as she
entered was a
tall, clean-shaven
man,
faultlessly
dressed in
glossy silk hat
and frock
coat, with a
flower in his
button-hole.
He looked
around for a
moment in
search of a
convenient
table. As he
hesitated, the
girl hesitated;
but when the waiter waved him to a small
table laid for two, the girl immediately
sat down behind him at the next table.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, madam," said the waiter,
"this table is set for four; would you
mind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I guess," said the girl, "I'll stay where
I am." And the look in her eyes, as well
as a certain sensation in the waiter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
palm, ensured her against further disturbance.</p>

<p>The restaurant was full of people lunching,
singly or in twos, in threes and even
larger parties; and many curious glances
were directed to the girl who sat at a table
alone and pursued her way calmly through
the menu. But the girl appeared to notice
no one. When her eyes were off her plate
they were fixed straight ahead&mdash;on the
back of the man who had entered in front
of her. The man, who had drunk a half-bottle
of champagne with his lunch,
ordered a liqueur to accompany
his coffee. The girl, who had
drunk an aerated water, leaned
back in her chair and wrinkled
her brows. They were very
straight brows, that seemed to
meet over her nose when she
wrinkled them in perplexity.
Then she called a waiter.</p>

<p>"Bring me a sheet of notepaper,
please," she said, "and
my bill."</p>

<p>The waiter laid
the sheet of paper
before her, and
the girl proceeded,
after a few moments
thought, to write
a few lines in
pencil upon it.
When this was
done, she folded
the sheet carefully,
and laid it
in her purse.
Then, having
paid her bill, she returned her purse to her
dress pocket, and waited patiently.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 443px;">
<img src="images/illus-0096.jpg" width="443" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"SHE WAS LOOKING INTO THE
MIRROR AND PATTING
HER HAIR."</p></div>
</div>

<p>In a few minutes the clean-shaven man
at the next table settled his bill and made
preparations for departure. The girl at
the same time drew on her gloves, keeping
her eyes immovably upon her neighbour's
back. As the man rose to depart, and
passed the table at which the girl had been
sitting, the girl was looking into the mirror
upon the wall, and patting her hair. Then
she turned and followed the man out of the
restaurant, while a pair at an adjacent table
remarked to one another that it was a rather
curious coincidence for a man and woman
to enter and leave at the same moment when
they had no apparent connection.</p>

<p>But what happened outside was even
more curious.</p>

<p>The man halted for a moment upon the
steps at the entrance. The porter, who was
in conversation with a policeman, turned,
whistle in hand.</p>

<p>"Hansom, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the clean-shaven man.</p>

<p>The porter was raising his whistle to his
lips when he noticed the girl behind.</p>

<p>"Do you wish for a cab, madam?" he
asked, and blew upon his whistle.</p>

<p>As he turned again for an answer, he
plainly saw the girl, who was standing
close behind the clean-shaven man, slip
her hand under his coat, and
snatch from his hip pocket
something which she quickly
transferred to her own.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm&mdash;&mdash;" began the
clean-shaven man, swinging
round and feeling in
his pocket.</p>

<p>"Have you missed
anything, sir?" said
the porter, standing
full in front of the
girl to bar her exit.</p>

<p>"My cigarette-case
is gone," said
the man, looking
from one side to another.</p>

<p>"What's this?" said the
policeman, stepping forward.</p>

<p>"I saw the woman's
hand in the gentleman's
pocket, plain as a pikestaff,"
said the porter.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, is it?"
said the policeman, coming
close to the girl. "I thought
as much."</p>

<p>"Come now," said the clean-shaven
man, "I don't want to make a fuss. Just
hand back that cigarette-case, and we'll
say no more about it."</p>

<p>"I haven't got it," said the girl. "How
dare you? I never touched your pocket."</p>

<p>The man's face darkened.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now!" said the porter.</p>

<p>"Look here, that won't do," said the
policeman, "you'll have to come along of
me. Better take a four-wheeler, eh, sir?"</p>

<p>For a knot of loafers, seeing something
interesting in the wind, had collected round
the entrance.</p>

<p>A four-wheeler was called, and the girl
entered, closely followed by the policeman
and the clean-shaven man.</p>

<p>"I was never so insulted in my life,"
said the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, she sat back quite calmly
in the cab, as though she was perfectly
ready to face this or any other situation,
while the policeman watched her closely to
make sure that she did not dispose in any
surreptitious way of the stolen article.</p>

<p>At the police station hard by, the usual
formalities were gone through, and the
clean-shaven man was constituted prosecutor.
But the girl stoutly denied having
been guilty of any offence.</p>

<p>The inspector in charge looked doubtful.</p>

<p>"Better search her," he said.</p>

<p>And the girl was led off to a room for an
interview with the female searcher.</p>

<p>The moment the door closed the girl put
her hand into her pocket, pulled out the
cigarette-case, and laid it upon the table.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 397px;">
<img src="images/illus-0097.jpg" width="397" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"'HAVE YOU MISSED ANYTHING?' SAID THE PORTER."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"There you are," she said. "That will
fix matters so far."</p>

<p>The woman looked rather surprised.</p>

<p>"Now," said the girl, holding out her
arms, "feel in this other pocket, and find
my purse."</p>

<p>The woman picked out the purse.</p>

<p>"Open it and read the note on the bit
of paper inside."</p>

<p>On the sheet of paper which the waiter
had given her, the girl had written these
words, which the searcher read in a muttered
undertone&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going to pick this man's pocket
as the best way of getting him into a
police-station without violence. He is
Colonel Mathurin, alias Rossiter, alias
Connell, and he is wanted in Detroit,
New York, Melbourne, Colombo, and
London. Get four men to pin him unawares,
for he is armed and desperate. I
am a member of the New York detective
force&mdash;Nora Van Snoop."</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Miss Van Snoop,
quickly, as the searcher looked up
at her after reading the note. "Show
that to the boss&mdash;right away."</p>

<p>The searcher opened the door.
After whispered consultation the inspector
appeared, holding the note
in his hand.</p>

<p>"Now then, be spry," said Miss
Van Snoop. "Oh, you needn't worry!
I've got my credentials right here,"
and she dived into another pocket.</p>

<p>"But do you know&mdash;can you be
sure," said the inspector, "that this
is the man who shot the Detroit
bank manager?"</p>

<p>"Great heavens! Didn't I see
him shoot Will Stevens with my
own eyes! And didn't I take service
with the police to hunt him
out?"</p>

<p>The girl stamped her foot, and
the inspector left. For two, three,
four minutes, she stood listening intently.
Then a muffled shout reached
her ears. Two minutes later the
inspector returned.</p>

<p>"I think you're right," he
said. "We have found enough
evidence on him to identify him.
But why didn't you give him
in charge before to the police?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to arrest him myself,"
said Miss Van Snoop,
"and I have. Oh, Will! Will!"</p>

<p>Miss Van Snoop sank into a
cane-bottomed chair, laid her head upon
the table, and cried. She had earned the
luxury of hysterics. In half an hour she
left the station, and, proceeding to a post-office,
cabled her resignation to the head
of the detective force in New York.</p>

<h2><a name="A_VERY_QUEER_CRICKET_MATCH" id="A_VERY_QUEER_CRICKET_MATCH">A VERY QUEER CRICKET MATCH.</a><br />

MR. DAN LENO'S ELEVEN <em>v.</em> CAMBERWELL UNITED C.C.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Gavin Macdonald.</span></p>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> has seen Mr. Dan Leno&mdash;King
Humorist of the variety stage.
Or if they haven't seen him, they have
heard of him.</p>

<p>As a singer, comedian, and grotesque
actor he is incomparable. As a cricketer
he dwarfs the reputation of the mighty
W. G. to mere nothingness.</p>

<p>Mr. Dan Leno is a modest, retiring man.
In a general way he practises in his back
yard, and confines his matches to the
prescribed area of the lawn-tennis plot at
the rear of his house. He says he has
done well in one sphere, and he spurns the
suggestion that he should enter another.</p>

<p>There is only one thing that will wean
him from his resolution, and in this the
members of his
profession resemble
him to a man.
In the cause of
charity they may
be relied upon to
throw all objections
aside.</p>

<p>It was at a
charity match
played recently
at Dulwich, in aid
of a local pension
fund, that I had
the pleasure of
witnessing the
most remarkable
exhibition of
cricket it has ever
been my lot to
witness.</p>

<p>It was advertised
as a one-day
match between
an eleven
of local
players captained
by Colonel Dalbiac,
M.P.,
and an eleven
of eccentric cricketers, known as Danites,
under the captaincy of Mr. Dan Leno.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 457px;">
<img src="images/illus-0098.jpg" width="457" height="530" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>MR. LENO AT THE WICKET.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The latter team was composed of the
following gentlemen, all more or less well
known to fame&mdash;Messrs. Dan Leno, Eugene
Stratton, Harry Randall, the Brothers
MacNaughton, Pastor, Glennister, Cobbett,
Joe Elvin, Griffiths, and Tressider.</p>

<p>The various preliminaries differed somewhat
from those usually in evidence on the
cricket field, but the 3,000 spectators enjoyed
them so much that it might be
advisable for the county clubs to follow
suit and ensure a big gate.</p>

<p>Punctually at the appointed time the
two elevens emerged from their tents and
showed themselves to the expectant crowd.
The Dulwich XI. were conventionally clad
in white flannels and club caps. Not so
the Danites. As they marched in single
file from their tent, a great silence came
over the multitude.
They were
stricken with an
astonishment too
deep for words.
Where was the
idol of the hour?
There was no
Dan Leno apparent
among those
grotesquely-clad
creatures.</p>

<p>The little man
in the van of the
procession, with
the tall silk cricketing
hat of a
bygone age, loose
holland bags
falling like
anæmic concertinas
over
his shoes, the
striped wool
blouse with
puffed sleeves
and the huge
black beard
and side whiskers.
Surely
that was not
he. The crowd looked hard. As they did so
the little man's features relaxed into an
elastic smile, so elastic that none could
mistake it. Then they cried, "Why, it's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Dan," and sat down and cheered till
they ached. One by one the other
members of this strange eleven were
identified through their disguises, and the
fun began.</p>

<p>The team marched in comic
single file round the field
at quick time. Every few
steps Capt. W.G. Daniel
Leno stopped to bow his
acknowledgments,
and as he
did so the remaining
ten ran forcibly
into each
other's backs and
rolled heavily
over each other
on the grass from
the force of impact.
Wigs, false
moustaches, and
other stage impedimenta
dropped
in the <em>mêlée</em>, and
the spectators
stood up on end
and swayed with
laughter.</p>

<p>At the wicket
Dr. W. G. D.
Leno met the
opponent captain.
There was a sporting handshake, and the
former skied the fateful coin. The crowd
wanted the Eccentrics to win the toss.
But there was little enough cause for
anxiety. Dan Leno had a double-headed
coin, and he called to it himself, which
conclusively settled the matter. He elected
to go in first.</p>

<p>Rightly or wrongly, he was of opinion that
the ordinary entry of the opening side was
a tame sort of affair. Dan Leno has something
of the old Roman in him. He likes
a state entry and the plaudits of the populace.
He and his team once more processed
off the field to a distant corner
where a dozen chargers brayed in melancholy
inactivity. Here all were mounted
satisfactorily but the fat man, whom it
took half-a-dozen men to hoist in the
saddle. Then to the music of a thousand
throats the team flew round the ground
and charged on to the wicket.</p>

<p>Never was entry so triumphal. The
splendidly-trained chargers swished their
tails majestically, and brayed in lieu of
trumpets. Then, without so much as a
command, they planted their fore feet firmly
on the green sward, dropped their riders
over their heads, and departed from whence
they came.</p>

<p>Dan Leno and T. MacNaughton took
their places at the wicket;
the remaining Danites,
contrary to custom, squatted
about the field,
and the match began.</p>

<p>The first ball
hit the middle
stump on the
top and downed
the wickets like
ninepins.
"How's that?"
called the Dulwich
team.
"Out," said the
umpire.</p>

<p>Dan Leno was
more than surprised,
he was
disgusted and
hurt. "Out?
What do you
mean?" he said,
with a glance of
contemptuous
pity at the umpire.
He called
a couple of his team to assist him in his
protest against such a palpable piece of
jobbery on the part of the opposition team.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen appealed to were
unanimous in their opinion that he could
not possibly be out. The thing was
absurd. The Dulwich team, umpire and
all, laughed so much that they were physically
incapable of doing or saying anything.
When you glance at the snapshot we
obtained of this tableau, you will not be
surprised at this.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MR. LENO'S SATISFACTORY
APPEAL AGAINST THE UMPIRE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the precise moment when their captain
was engaged in an attempt to prove
that the bowling of the middle stump did
not necessarily imply being out, some
member of his team cried, "Trial ball."
It was a happy thought. In a moment
the field was in an uproar. "Yes, yes&mdash;trial
ball!" came from all sides. The
plea was allowed, and Dan went in again
to the tune of frantic laughter and applause.
As the next ball came up he
dropped his bat, caught it in his hat, and
ran. He scored ten runs, and then quietly
handed the ball over to the bowler again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
Nobody objected to this novel method
of scoring. Everybody enjoyed it too
much to dream of protesting.</p>

<p>The Danites had opened the match
with a useful ten, but there was more to
follow. T. MacNaughton was now at the
batting end, and he drove the ball out to
boundary over the heads of some of the
Danites sitting on the grass.</p>

<p>Before any of the field reached it, one of
these gentlemen slipped quietly to the edge
of the crowd, picked up the ball, and disappeared.</p>

<p>When he had chatted to a few friends
and visited the refreshment booth, he
returned and laid it quietly on the field
again. Messrs. Leno and MacNaughton
were standing at the wickets utterly blown,
with another twenty runs to their names,
and the field were playing hide and
seek among the spectators searching for
the lost leather.</p>

<p>The captain's
wicket went
down a score of
times. They
were all trial
balls. He was
stumped over
and over again,
but he maintained
that, as
he had never
been stumped
before, he
couldn't be now,
and stuck doggedly
to the
wicket.</p>

<p>He looked
like carrying his
bat out, and
MacNaughton
was scoring
steadily the
whole time, tens
and twelves being
common incidents
of the
play, especially
when an enthusiastic
Danite
succeeded in
getting hold of
the ball and threw it to the opposite side
of the field, from whence it had to be fielded
all over again.</p>

<p>However, there is an end to all things.
A good curling ball sent the valiant
W. G. D. L.'s stumps to the four corners of
the heavens, and the umpire gave him out.</p>

<p>In vain he protested "Trial ball," his own
side were in agreement, and he was invited
to leave the crease. Little Dan said he
was there, and there he meant to be.</p>

<p>Unfortunately at that moment a Danite,
rigged out as an inspector of police, pulled
out a whistle and blew it shrilly. The
whole field followed him, and, kicking,
blowing, and raving against umpires and
their decisions, the hero of the hour was
borne forcibly from the field.</p>

<p>A wave of deep distress came over the
spectators as Dan Leno was carried out.
All felt that, in view of his unexampled
performance, he ought to have carried out
his bat.</p>

<p>Nobody can say the Danite XI. were
not good sportsmen. They all stuck to
the wickets till they were carried off.</p>

<p>Harry Randall
made a
brave show of
sticking, but the
odds were overwhelming.</p>

<p>Mr. Eugene
Stratton's left-handed
batting
elicited the
warmest approval
by reason of
its novelty. This
may be accounted
for by the fact
that he is an
American, and
prior to this occasion
had never
played any
game but baseball.</p>

<p>Bowling is
Mr. Harry Randall's
strong
point. His delivery
is unique,
and the sight of
him should be
of practical
value to aspiring
trundlers.</p>

</div>

<p>At lunch time
all the Danites were out. Then came the
rub. Owing to various eccentricities on
the part of the players, a detailed score had
not been kept. Captain Leno was appealed
to. He said he didn't actually know how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
many they had made. The runs were so
numerous he couldn't keep up with them.
However, he observed that his side "felt"
as though it had made at least 275 runs.
They had probably made twice as many.
Accordingly the first innings was closed
at that, to the entire satisfaction of everybody,
including the spectators, who cried
with laughter at this new method of settling
off old scores.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MR. EUGENE STRATTON AS A BATSMAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After lunch the Eccentrics took the field,
and the Dulwich men went to the
wickets.</p>

<p>Hereafter it was cricket extraordinary,
and no funnier burlesque was
ever seen upon the stage. The bowlers
were not bowlers, but they were excellent
mimics. They knew it was
the correct thing to stroll
away from the wicket and
back again before a delivery.
They walked a
quarter of a mile or so to
the boundary each time,
and returned at 20 miles
an hour in the most approved
style, launching
the ball at a terrific pace. The very
first ball was at least ten yards wide,
but somebody called, "How's that?"
"Out!" said the umpire, and "Out"
it had to be. The batsman looked
blankly from one to the other. He was too
stupefied to protest. Had he done so it
would not have helped matters. He had
been given "out," and out he had to go.
The Danites threw the ball madly skyward.
They careered against each, rolled in one
indistinguishable mass on the grass, and
yelled till they were hoarse. The crack
player of the opposition eleven gone&mdash;out
without a run! The next ball missed the
wickets, but it clean bowled the fat man,
and he rolled along the grass like a wind-driven
hat.</p>

<p>When twenty or thirty balls had been
sent up by the boundary-walking trundlers
somebody called "Over," and the Danites
quadrilled gracefully over the pitch. This
little manœuvre occurred at every over.</p>

<p>The next Dulwich man was knocked
out in a peculiar and novel way. He did
not touch the ball at all, but the fat wicket-keeper
ran in and caught it from the
bowler's hands. Then he threw it in the
air. "How's that?" he cried. "Out!"
cried Dan Leno, neatly catching it in his top
hat. The batsman laughed, and the spectators
joined him. "How's that?" asked
Captain Leno of the umpire. "Out," responded
the latter. The batsman walked
sadly from the wickets. He thought he
must have been standing without the
crease, and had been stumped without
noticing it.</p>

<p>So brilliant was the play of the Danites
that the other team by one means or
another were got out for an "estimated"
total of 25 runs.</p>

LATEST MARKET PRICES.</h2>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">"Good</span> postage stamps" said a leading
expert to the writer a few days
since, "are one of the soundest investments
you can hold." That this is so is amply
proved by a glance at the steadily increasing
prices quoted for the celebrated blue
Mauritius.</p>

<p>With a view to ascertaining some interesting
particulars of the present market
prices of some of the rarer varieties of
stamps, I called upon Mr. Phillips, who is
one of our greatest philatelic experts and
manager of the great collecting firm of
Messrs. Stanley Gibbons, Ltd.</p>

<p>The result was extremely interesting, as
a perusal of the facts of this article will
demonstrate.</p>

<p>There are two varieties of the 1847
Mauritius, a 1<em>d.</em> red
and 2<em>d.</em> blue. The
stamp is particularly
distinguished, as will
be observed in our
illustration, by the
words "Post Office"
on the left-hand side
instead of the more
usual "Post Paid."</p>

<p>Owing to its rarity
and the increased interest
evinced by all
classes in stamp collecting,
the value of this stamp has gone
up by leaps and bounds.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 530px;">
<img src="images/illus-0102d.jpg" width="530" height="304" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THESE TWO STAMPS WERE SOLD FOR £1,000.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is a good specimen in the British
Museum collection. It was purchased
fifteen years ago for the modest sum of
£70. I say modest, because
in 1887, when another
specimen came into
the market, it realised no
less a sum than £200,
showing an advance of
£130.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 294px;">
<img src="images/illus-0102e.jpg" width="294" height="411" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>SOLD FOR £740.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But this was by no
means a top price. The
next transaction in blue
Mauritius was the sale of
a pair which after a spirited competition
were knocked down to Messrs. Stanley
Gibbons, Ltd., for £680&mdash;the price, by the
way, of a well-matched pair of thoroughbreds.
In 1897 the last transaction took
place in this variety, when another pair
changed hands for the respectable consideration
of £1,921.</p>

<p>So that if by hook or crook you can get
hold of an 1847 blue Mauritius, there is a
fortune in store for you. However, so far
as collectors know, there are only some 23
specimens of the two varieties&mdash;11 of the
one and 12 of the other&mdash;in existence.</p>

<p>Most people imagine the Mauritius to
be the rarest and most valuable of stamps.
In this they are wrong. Mr. Phillips credits
the 1856 British Guiana, black on magenta,
with this honour.</p>

<p>By an error, which
was quickly rectified,
certain of these
stamps were lettered
"one" instead of
"four." If you can
obtain a copy in
which this error is
apparent, it will readily
bring £1,000.</p>

<p>At present only one
copy is known to be
in existence, and that
is in Paris. It holds an honoured place in the
magnificent collection belonging to Mons.
Ferrary, son of the late Duchess Galliera.</p>

<p>The red variety of this stamp without
the error is worth only £25. In blue, it
may fetch anything from
£100 to £300, according
to condition.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>FETCHES £250.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Hawaiian or Sandwich
Islands issued a set
of four stamps in 1851.
Their face values were
2 cents, 5 cents, and
13 cents, the last mentioned
being issued in two
varieties. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
local low value stamps marked "Hawaiian&mdash;U.S."
and were used for the purpose of
franking letters to San Francisco.</p>

<p>The 2 cent variety is the most valuable.
Messrs. Stanley Gibbons, Ltd., have
been dealing in stamps for 40 years,
and they have handled only two
copies. The last one sold&mdash;a
used specimen&mdash;fetched £740.
The British Museum collection
includes two copies, and
no other specimens exist in
Great Britain. There are three
or four copies in the United States, and
some eight copies in Europe. These are
the only specimens in existence.</p>

<p>The 5 cent and 13 cent varieties are not
so valuable, though they may be relied
upon to fetch a good round sum. A 5 cent
copy unused, in average condition, is worth
£250; used, from £80 to £100.</p>

<p>A 13 cent specimen in average condition
will realise £250 unused, and £75 used.</p>

<p>Another British Guiana stamp is extremely
valuable&mdash;the
2 cent circular variety,
issued in 1851, and
bearing the postmaster's
signature as a guarantee
of authenticity.</p>

<p>There are only some
ten or eleven copies in
existence.</p>

</div>

<p>The pair on the
previous page have a
history as romantic as anything we have
ever heard. Four years ago they were
found by an old lady residing in a little
village outside Demerara. The vicar of
the local church was endeavouring to
raise an endowment fund, and the old lady,
who understood they were of some value,
though she had no idea to what extent,
presented them to the clergyman, and
asked him to sell them and devote the
proceeds to the fund.</p>

<p>He sold them to a member of the Legislative
Council of Demerara for £205, who
in turn sent them to Messrs. Stanley
Gibbons, Ltd. The firm gave
him £650 for the pair. He thus
realised an immediate profit of
£445.</p>

<p>But this was by no means the
top price; within three weeks of
their receipt Messrs. Stanley Gibbons,
Ltd., resold them to a Bavarian
dealer in Germany for £780,
who immediately parted with them
to a well-known Russian collector, who
was in want of specimens, for £1,000.</p>

<p>One cannot help sympathising with the
original finder. However, it is more than
probable she is ignorant of their real
value to this day.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>PRICE UNUSED&mdash;£500.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another stamp that has risen prodigiously
in value of late years
is that known as the Cape of
Good Hope issue of 1861. It
is known to collectors as one
of the errors of 1861, for the
following reason.</p>

<p>Just prior to the perpetration of the
error, the supply of stamps issued to the
colony by the Home authorities ran out,
and a local printer was commissioned to
produce a temporary supply.</p>

<p>In printing these he made a mistake, the
result of which was that the 4<em>d.</em> and 1<em>d.</em>
stamps were mixed up. As a consequence
many of the 4<em>d.</em> stamps were marked 1<em>d.</em> by
mistake, and were the same colour as that
used in the former variety.</p>

<p>In 1863 specimens of
these errors were sold at
2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> each. To-day
used copies readily fetch
from £60 to £70 apiece.</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips says he
has only seen one unused
copy, and that was
sold for £500.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>OBSOLETE CASHMERE
STAMP.</p></div>
</div>

<p>An interesting specimen
is the native stamp
issued by the Maharajah of Cashmere in
1866. It is the rarest of native varieties,
and was made by the natives of Jummoo
and printed on rice paper.</p>

<p>It is in three values&mdash;½ anna, 1 anna,
and 4 annas, all of which are rare, and
worth from £30 to £60 apiece. We are
able to illustrate only two of these stamps,
the ½ and 1 anna values.</p>

<p>This stamp is now obsolete, the Government
having made arrangements for the
use of British stamps in Cashmere.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 251px;">
<img src="images/illus-0103d.jpg" width="251" height="251" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>STAMP WITH
QUEEN'S HEAD
UPSIDE DOWN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A curious error occurred in the manufacture
of a stamp issued by the
Indian Government in 1854, all
the stamps of one printing appearing
with the Queen's head turned
upside down. It was a 4 anna
stamp, printed in red and blue.</p>

<p>Copies of the correct stamp may
be purchased for 5<em>s.</em> But a specimen
in which the inverted head
appears is worth £150, and not
more than twenty copies exist.</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
